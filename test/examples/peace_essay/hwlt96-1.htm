<p>&nbsp;<strong></p>

<p>Destructive Confrontation </strong></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Ethnicity, race, religion, gender roles, economic policy,
school policy, land use and re-distribution, environmental protection--in socially,
religiously, and politically diverse societies, continuing conflicts over such complex and
deep-rooted issues are inevitable. Such &quot;intractable&quot; conflicts tend to arise
from four overlapping sources: 1) fundamental moral conflicts in which one group views the
actions of another as intolerably evil, 2) high-stakes distributional questions over
&quot;who gets what,&quot; 3) social status conflicts which arise as people compete for
preferred positions in the social hierarchy, and 4) identity conflicts in which
individuals or a group of people are denied respect and recognition on the basis of their
individual and/or group identity.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">While these conflicts play a crucial role in determining
the course of social progress, they can also be extremely destructive. They breed
distrust, hostility, and too often, violence. Even at lower levels of intensity, such
intractable conflicts are time consuming and expensive. They can quickly escalate to the
point where thoughtful debate is lost amid rampant misunderstanding, fear, and threat.
These dynamics not only undermine advocates' pursuit of justice and wise decisions, they
also prevent the parties from taking advantage of the many collaborative,
&quot;win-win&quot; opportunities that do exist. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Often people involved in these conflicts recognize their
destructiveness, yet they view their cause as so important, or compromise as so
unconscionable, that they continue to pursue destructive strategies in the face of
enormous costs and limited prospects for success. Stalemates, in which critical issues
remain unresolved for protracted periods, are common. Often the result is continuation of
status quo policies which nobody supports.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Even when decisions are made, destructive conflict
dynamics can cause them to be poorly conceived and ineffective. Decisions may fail to
balance competing interests fairly, or they may be so technically, economically, socially,
or politically flawed that they cannot achieve desired results or even be implemented as
intended. The hostility generated by these conflicts frequently spawns a continuing series
of a destructive confrontations in which the core issues are never really resolved. In
order to better deal with these important issues we, as individuals, as communities, and
as societies, must learn how to handle our conflicts in more constructive ways.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><strong>Limits of Current Agreement-Based Approaches</strong></font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Given the destructiveness of these confrontations, it is
easy to conclude that conflict itself is the problem. Many think that, if the parties
could simply be shown win-win solutions, then the conflicts could be permanently resolved
and the heavy costs of confrontation could be avoided. This belief that win-win solutions
can be found to almost any conflict has helped spur the enormous growth and
institutionalization of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) processes. While ADR has
proven remarkably successful in dealing with tractable conflicts--those in which
&quot;win-win&quot; opportunities really do exist--it has not been nearly as effective in
handling conflicts, such as those described above, that have significant and irreducible
&quot;win-lose&quot; components.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Parties to intractable conflict often view efforts to
negotiate a compromise &quot;resolution&quot; with considerable skepticism or even
outright hostility. Given the importance that the parties attach to these high-stakes
conflicts, it is unrealistic to expect them to voluntarily accept an agreement if they
believe that their interests can be better advanced through some force-based strategy
(e.g. litigation, lobbying, elections, strikes, boycotts, non-violent protests, or
military campaigns). In these situations, even the best conflict resolution strategies are
usually unsuccessful. Given these failures and the apparent lack of an alternative
approach, many people conclude that there are no viable alternatives to destructive,
all-out confrontation. The result is that the field seems to have reached a plateau in
which there is considerable opposition to the expanded use of alternative approaches.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><strong>Moving Beyond the Limits</strong> </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">The limitations of resolution-based approaches have led
the Consortium to pursue an alternative strategy. We begin with the assumption that
intense, long-term conflicts over difficult moral and distributional issues are inevitable
and appropriate. After all, these conflicts play a crucial role in determining how society
addresses fundamental issues of morality, justice, and progress. What is not inevitable,
we believe, is the destructiveness commonly associated with these confrontations. Thus,
the primary goal of our work is the identification and dissemination of information about
realistic measures that disputants and intermediaries can take to increase the
constructiveness of intractable conflicts.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">We believe that this reframing of the basic conflict
problem can substantially increase the ability of the field to limit the destructive
aspects of intractable conflicts, while supporting the positive functions of conflict for
the parties and for society as a whole. Our ultimate goal is to help disputing parties
improve decisions, while reducing transactions costs (as measured in terms of time, money,
and, all too often, blood).</font></p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><strong>The Incremental Approach</strong></font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">We believe that an incremental approach offers the best
way to reduce the destructiveness of confrontations over intractable issues. This approach
begins by helping parties (both adversaries and intermediaries) identify conflict problems
which increase the conflict's overall destructiveness or threaten the parties' ability to
make wise decisions or advance their interests. We then provide parties with information
about options for dealing with each problem and their advantages and disadvantages. While
it is usually impossible to correct all such problems, our goal is to help people fix as
many of the problems as possible, and reduce the magnitude of problems that cannot be
eliminated .</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Although many of our &quot;treatments&quot; require the
cooperative efforts of contending parties (often with the assistance of intermediaries),
others can be implemented unilaterally. Similarly, some treatments are relatively easy to
implement, while others require that the parties develop new dispute-handling skills or
secure the assistance of outside professionals. Unlike other forms of dispute resolution,
this incremental approach can work in situations where resolution-based approaches are
unworkable. It also makes sense in cases where it is unrealistic to expect major changes
in dispute-handling process or decision-making institutions.</font></p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><strong>Accumulating Knowledge Base</strong></font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">While there are no proven and reliable strategies for
resolving intractable conflicts, the field's accumulating knowledge base does offer a rich
array of ideas for making inevitable confrontations far more constructive. Some of these
ideas have a long history as essential elements of every dispute resolution practitioner's
toolbox. Also of great value are many of the dispute handling techniques used by the many
more traditional conflict professionals (e.g. politicians, lawyers, soldiers, and judges).
Other useful ideas arise from basic research and theory building in the social sciences
where all that is needed is to present the ideas in widely understandable terms, rather
than inscrutable academic lingo. Finally, there are the creative ideas of citizens who are
struggling to find better ways of dealing with the difficult conflicts that they confront
in their daily lives.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">At this point the Consortium has identified more than 125
common problems which undermine the constructiveness with which intractable conflicts are
addressed. More encouraging is the fact that we have also identified 150 realistic steps
which can be taken to limit these problems. We have arranged these problems and treatments
into nine categories found in Figure 1. (Examples of problems and treatments in each
category are found in Appendix 1 with a complete listing found in Appendix 2.) </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">A principal advantage of this problem/treatment approach
is that it is highly adaptable to the special circumstances of particular conflicts. There
is no single approach which can be expected to work in all situations. Each conflict
creates different combinations of problems which require different combinations of
treatments.</font></p>

<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><strong>Helping Adversaries, Not Just Intermediaries</strong></font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Unlike intermediaries who want to resolve conflicts,
adversaries often want victory more than they want resolution. They often distrust dispute
resolution, because they think it will force them to compromise or give up what they want
or need. To be successful, conflict professionals (both practitioners and educators) must
demonstrate how application of the field's expertise can help disputants more effectively
pursue their objectives. Any conflict intervention program which fails to obtain the
support of the parties is doomed to failure. This is why a major focus of the Consortium's
work has been the application of the field's insights from the first-party, adversarial
perspective, as well as the traditional, third-party, neutral perspective. </font></p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><strong>Dissemination</strong></font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">The key to realizing the potential benefits of the
expanding knowledge base in our field is an effective and affordable strategy for promptly
disseminating ideas to those who can profitably use them. Without such a capability, far
too many people will be forced to &quot;reinvent the wheel.&quot; Dissemination processes
are needed which precisely focus upon the needs of two different groups--part-time,
&quot;do-it-yourselfers&quot; and dispute handling professionals. Of these two groups, it
is the do-it-yourselfers that have been most neglected by traditional training programs.</font><br
WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><strong>Part-Time, Do-It-Yourselfers</strong></font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Professional conflict intervention is expensive. Only a
tiny percentage of conflict-related interactions can be facilitated by conflict
professionals. Most interactions are handled by either the parties themselves or informal
intermediaries. For these people, confrontation and conflict resolution is a
&quot;do-it-yourself&quot; activity. In the absence of effective training, these
individuals are likely to employ &quot;seat-of-the-pants&quot; approaches which fail to
benefit from either scientific studies of conflict processes or the practical experiences
of those who have struggled with similar conflicts in the past. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Most of these do-it-yourselfers are also
&quot;part-timers&quot; with many other pressing demands on their time. This means that
any dissemination program must be extremely efficient or people won't have time to use it.
Effective training programs must be precisely focused on the user's immediate
problems--do-it-yourselfers don't have time to learn how to deal with somebody else's
problems. They usually don't have much money to spend either. A typical one week,
$500-$1000 training program is likely to be completely out of reach to most parties to
intractable conflicts. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">A major focus of the Consortium program has been the
development of better ways of disseminating the field's knowledge to these individuals.
Our dissemination efforts are offered in the spirit of information sharing and not
paternalistic outside experts who &quot;know what's good for people.&quot; We view our
role as giving people things to think about. We trust them to decide which of our ideas
are truly applicable to their situation. </font></p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><strong>Windows of Opportunity</strong></font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Effective dissemination programs must also be able to work
within a narrow &quot;window of opportunity.&quot; There is usually a brief period between
the time that individuals are presented with a conflict problem and the time when they
must commit themselves to a particular course of action. If better options can be provided
to these individuals during this critical window, they are likely to take them. They are
also likely to return to this resource in the future as additional conflict problems
arise. This, in turn, is likely to lead to long-term improvements in their overall
conflict skills. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">If such information is not forthcoming, the parties can be
expected to stick with often destructive, &quot;business-as-usual&quot; practices. In
short, information provided outside of this window is likely to be of limited utility. A
major focus of the Consortium program has, therefore, been the creation of a dissemination
program that works within these narrow time constraints<strong>.</strong></font></p>

<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><strong>Helping Intermediaries Better Deal With
Intractable Conflicts</strong></font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">While professional intermediaries may be unable to resolve
intractable conflicts, there is much that they can do to help the parties' more
constructively deal with confrontations over intractable issues. In some cases these
professionals may be able to apply old skills in new ways. In other cases they may be able
to increase their effectiveness by mastering new skills. Here somewhat different
approaches are needed for formal intermediaries (arbitrators, mediators, and
facilitators), decision makers (judges, politicians, and business executives), and
community leaders who play an important role helping citizens deal with conflict. </font></p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><strong>Helping Advocates Better Deal With Intractable
Conflicts</strong></font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">While many steps toward increasing the constructiveness of
the confrontation process can best be taken by neutral intermediaries, there are other
steps which can be better taken from an advocacy perspective. One example involves the
empowerment of the disempowered. Although many intermediaries try to &quot;level the
playing field&quot; by empowering the lower-power parties, they cannot do much empowerment
without compromising their neutrality. For this reason, we believe that it is useful to
create separate roles for conflict professionals--neutral intermediaries and partisan
advocacy advisors or coaches. Here the later can freely pursue empowerment goals while the
former can take advantage of opportunities available only to true neutrals. These advisors
can show the parties how a more sophisticated understanding of conflict dynamics can help
them better pursue their interests. This understanding can help the parties see
alternative approaches as well as legal, political and other force-based strategies in a
broader perspective.</font></p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><strong>The Web: The Tool That Is Making It All Possible</strong></font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">The Consortium is using the interactive capabilities of
the world-wide-web to build a high quality, online, &quot;consulting service&quot; that
can provide users with &quot;executive summaries&quot; highlighting options for dealing
with their specific conflict problems. These summaries also include links to sources of
in-depth, follow-up information on each topic. These sources include full-text, online
write-ups, links to high quality web accessible documents, and printed documents available
through online ordering channels.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">This system has a number of benefits. First, it enables us
to quickly and inexpensively provide users around the world with a tremendous amount of
information. Second, the information can be organized and linked in ways which let users
find what they need quickly without having to wade through lots of information that they
don't care about. Another advantage of this system is that its use is private. People do
not have to admit to anyone their dispute handling skills are limited. They can even use
the ideas found in the system to enhance their own reputation as someone who has good
ideas for dealing with difficult situations. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">In the next few years, technological developments already
in the pipeline will open up exciting new opportunities. For example, many users will be
able to take advantage of online audio and video. Of greater importance will be the fact
that falling costs will extend the web's reach to poorer communities around the world
which do not yet have access to reliable and affordable computing and telecommunications
services.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">While the system described above does not yet exist, the
first working version will go online this spring. At that point, we will enter a period in
which the system is field tested and refined. We also plan to prepare specialized versions
focused upon particular classes of conflicts. Beyond this there will be a continuing
effort to incorporate new ideas, better explanations, more real world case studies, and,
especially, success stories into the system.</font></p>

<p><em>NOTE: There has been considerable debate within the Consortium regarding the
appropriate name for the difficult conflicts with which we are concerned. To some, the
dictionary definition of the term &quot;intractable&quot; sums it up nicely&#151;difficult
but not necessarily impossible. To others, the term seems too hopeless. There is also
concern that intractable may be interpreted as implying that the parties somehow failed to
adequately fulfill their responsibilities. For this reason, some of us prefer the term
&quot;long-term, continuing conflict.&quot; Still others like the term,
&quot;resolution-resistant conflict.&quot; In Consortium publications all of these terms
are used.</em> </p>
