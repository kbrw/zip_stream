<p>Jay Rothman, Resolving Identity-Based Conflict: In Nations, Organizations, and
Communities, (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1997). </p>

<p>Identity conflicts engage strong passions and can lead to great destruction. Rothman
argues that identity-based conflicts also have the potential to be transformative and
creative. Drawing on his own experiences in conflict resolution and on existing
theoretical models, Rothman develops his ARIA framework for transforming identity
conflicts into productive relations.</p>

<p>Identity Conflicts</p>

<p>Identity-based conflicts are often mistaken for disputes over material resources.
Attempts to resolve such misdiagnosed conflicts generally fail, since the resolution
efforts do not address the real underlying causes of the conflict. Hence the first step in
effective resolution is correctly identifying a conflict as an identity conflict. Rothman
contrasts identity-based conflicts to interest-based disputes. Interest-based conflicts
tend to be more concrete, the issues more clearly defined, and the potential for mutual
benefit more obvious. Identity-based conflicts are based in people's psychology, culture,
basic values, shared history, and beliefs. Identity conflicts threaten people's basic
needs and very survival. These issues tend to be more abstract, ambiguous and intangible.
Identity conflicts may be expressed as material disputes, in an attempt to give focus to
the parties' concerns. Material disputes may evolve into identity conflicts, as the
disputants invest themselves in the dispute and come to identify with their positions.
Once a conflict has been correctly analyzed, the next step toward resolution is to make
explicit the sources of identity threat and insecurity, and the parties' needs. Resolution
proceeds by having the parties dialogue about their needs and values. Rothman argues that
such dialog can promote the empowerment and recognition needed to transform the conflict
into a more productive relationship.</p>

<p>ARIA: A Framework for Transforming Identity Conflicts</p>

<p>The ARIA framework is named for the four phases of its process: Antagonism, Resonance,
Invention, and Action. The ARIA framework describes a dialogue and reconciliation process
which can &quot;foster harmony and resonance from adversaries' full and honest expression
of the deeply felt human motivations that lie beneath their conflict.&quot;[p. 18] Though
Rothman describes the four stages in progression, he cautions that the ARIA process is
dynamic. The dialog may loop back to earlier phases of discussion. The action phase may
lead cyclically back to antagonism. Rothman calls the first phase the antagonism phase.
The goal of this phase is to bring suppressed differences to the surface, and to analyze
the sources of the parties' animosity. Participants are asked to air their grievances.
Facilitators are present to set boundaries and keep the venting from getting out of
control. Identity conflicts are usually framed adversarially. Signs of adversarial framing
include blaming the other side, polarizing the parties, attributing negative
characteristics to the other side, and projecting one's own negative traits onto the other
side. This type of framing is generally not productive. However, by allowing the
participants to vent this unproductive accusations, the ARIA process will encourage
participants to reframe their conflict in more productive terms.</p>

<p>Having exhausted (for the moment at least) their antagonism, and discouraged by
unproductive blaming, the participants are ready to move on to the resonance phase. In the
resonance phase, discussion focuses on identifying the parties' common needs and shared
motivations. This serves to reframe the conflict from the unproductive adversarial frame
to a more productive reflexive frame. Rather than focus on the other side, each party is
encouraged to reflect objectively on their own needs and fears. Rather than blaming,
parties are encouraged to reflect on and take responsibility for their own actions and
choices in the conflict. In place of negative attribution and projection, participants
seek to understand the opponent's perspective and to better understand their own
character. In the resonance phase participants move away from an &quot;Us versus
Them&quot; attitude toward a &quot;We&quot; attitude.</p>

<p>Thus reframed, the conflict is ripe for inventive solutions. In the invention phase the
parties work together to generate solutions which meet their common needs and shared
interests. One way to generate new solutions is to begin by developing a broad statement
of shared objectives and then go on to work out the details. Rothman also describes three
cooperative problem-solving techniques. Opposed demands may be based on different, but
ultimately compatible, interests. Differentiating the parties' underlying interests can
lead to cooperative solutions. Seeking to expand the amount or availability of contested
resources can lead to cooperative, mutually beneficial solutions. When neither
differentiation nor expansion are possible, one party may agree give up the contested
resource in exchange for some compensation. This compensation can take many forms. </p>

<p>Once a solution has been agreed upon, it must be implemented. In the action phase the
parties develop an implementation agenda. First, participants must decide on the scale of
the action. Beginning with a fairly specific, limited program can be a helpful way of
building trust between the larger communities. Larger scale institutional projects may be
needed to implement more complex, multifaceted solutions. The most ambitious
implementation action is to enter into more formal political negotiations in an attempt to
bring more sweeping resolutions to the community at large. Whatever the scale, any
implementation agenda should answer four basic questions: who, what, why, and how? It
should specify the project's goals and intended outcomes. It should make explicit the
parties' motivations in undertaking the action. It should specify who is to undertake
implementation, and the means that will be used. </p>

<p>Applying the ARIA Framework</p>

<p>Rothman describes the use of ARIA in national, organizational and community settings.
For identity conflicts at the national level, ARIA dialogues can be a effective form of
prenegotiation. Rothman describes his use of ARIA workshops in the Jerusalem Peace
Initiative. Israeli and Palestinian students, activists, community leaders, professionals
and diplomats were brought together in a series of workshops to &quot;discuss the human
dimension of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict over Jerusalem.&quot;[p. 88] Rothman
recounts the group's progress. By the end of the workshops, the participants agreed on a
general statement of principle--that they must learn better ways to live together in
Jerusalem--and made concrete policy proposals designed to advance cooperative living in
each of five areas of life. The participants also developed specific confidence-building
initiatives in each area. Rothman concludes that &quot;when formal negotiations are
completely deadlocked, the work of peace can still proceed at the human and functional
levels...thus laying the groundwork for renewed negotiations later.&quot;[p. 107]</p>

<p>The ARIA framework has also been used to deal effectively with organizational
conflicts. Drawing on actual experiences, Rothman presents a composite case of
management-labor conflict. Ongoing tension between management and the union had eventually
resulted in conflicts within each side. Morale was low, distrust high. Through union
workshops and management retreats participants were able to use the ARIA process to
transform relationships within the union and within management, and ultimately to improve
the union-management relationship. Rothman uses a case of community-based conflict to
illustrate several specific ARIA tools and guidelines for applying the ARIA framework. In
order to determine whether a particular conflict is an identity conflict, Rothman has
developed an identity conflict assessment tool. Conflicts are assessed in terms of their
focus, basis and goals. Identity conflicts tend to focus on historical or psychological
factors, be based on the parties values or beliefs, and to have intangible or complex
goals. Interest conflicts are focused on goods or services, are based on socioeconomic
factors, and have tangible, concrete goals. Another helpful tool is the conflict audit.
&quot;A conflict audit is designed to give the third party-analyst necessary information
about the range of conflict issues and negative affect surrounding the specific triggering
issue, as well as the larger context within which it is embedded.&quot;[p. 150] By means
of interviews or dialogue with the participants the facilitator should identify the
identity issues, interests, motivating forces and restraining forces at play in the
conflict. The participants should also be directly involved in generating the audit.</p>

<p>Rothman concludes this text by presenting a &quot;road map&quot; of a typical two-day
workshop. The workshop opens with the antagonism phase, which typically takes about two
hours. The facilitator opens this phase with basic questions, such as &quot;what is this
conflict about?&quot; The facilitator will close this phase by asking the group to reflect
on how they feel about the discussion they have just had, and by charting the positions
revealed in discussion. The resonance phase generally takes about four hours and concludes
the first day. Each side is asked to explain why they hold their positions, and what they
need or fear. When the sides are very hostile this phase may begin by having each group
clarify their reasons and needs separately, and then bringing the groups together to share
their reflections. The facilitator will help the group focus on their shared needs. The
integrative invention phase should take about two hours. Participants are broken up into
mixed groups, where they brainstorm for ideas which would satisfy the shared needs
identified in the previous phase. Finally, during the action planning phase, the group
reassembles and evaluates the proposals from the invention phase. Working together the
participants craft project proposals. The facilitator helps to ensure that each proposal
answers the basic questions: what is the initiative and who, why, and how will this
initiative be implemented. </p>
