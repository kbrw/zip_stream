<p>Raymond Cohen, Negotiating Across Cultures: Communication Obstacles in International
Diplomacy, (Washington, D.C.: United States Institute of Peace Press, 1991).</p>

<p>Cohen argues that cross-cultural differences have significant effects on diplomatic
negotiations. Failure to understand and appreciate theses differences can have serious
consequences for negotiations. In this text Cohen explores the role cultural differences
play in shaping the content, process, and style of negotiations.</p>

<p>Cultural Differences</p>

<p>&quot;Diplomatic negotiation consists of a process of communication between states
seeking to arrive at a mutually acceptable outcome on some issue of shared
concern.&quot;[p. 7] This process of communication can be profoundly affected by differing
cultural conventions, norms, meanings, assumptions, ideals and perceptions. The problems
of inter-cultural communication have received increased attention in recent years, and
Cohen reviews briefly some of the main theorists working in this field. Cohen's own
approach is to combine these theoretical frameworks with analyses of case studies,
focusing particularly on cases of negotiation between Western and non-Western states. </p>

<p>Cohen rejects the notion that a single international diplomatic culture has developed,
which makes diplomats' native cultures largely irrelevant. He finds that seasoned
diplomats reports that cultural differences have a significant impact. Theoretic studies
show that culture plays a large role in shaping the individuals' character. This
constitutive impact of culture cannot be erased by mere exposure to other cultures.</p>

<p>Cohen draws primarily on Lorand Szalay's theory of inter-cultural communication. Szalay
begins by distinguishing between the form and content of a message. The form of the
message serves to encode its meaning. Understanding a message is a matter of the receiver
correctly decoding it, so that the receiver's intention matches the sender's meaning.
Szalay says, &quot;Since the encoder and the decoder are two separate individuals their
reactions are likely to be similar only to the extent that they share experiences, that
they have similar frames of reference. The more different they are, the less isomorphism
there will be between encoded and decoded content.&quot;[p. 20] Cultural similarity
provides a shared frame of reference, while individuals from divergent cultures are more
likely to have different experiences and frames of reference. Cohen draws on this model to
identify several very basic, very general differences between cultures. First is the
contrast between cultures with an individualistic ethos and cultures which emphasize
interdependence and collective identity. In collectivist cultures, communication tends to
be very context-sensitive. Communication forms emphasize politeness,
relationship-building, tact, and even indirectness. Individualistic cultures de-emphasize
the communication context and personal relationships. Communication is direct and
explicit, with little patience for rhetoric, allusion, or complex etiquette. </p>

<p>Another important contrast is between cultures with polychronic and monochronic
concepts of time. Monochronic cultures tend to regiment time. Schedules and timetables are
given great weight. Haste is a virtue. Such cultures are future-oriented; the past is
important only insofar as it affects present and future plans. Polychronic culture take a
more leisurely view of time. Time moves in greater and lesser cycles, independent of human
wants. Patience and steadiness are virtues. Polychronic cultures tend to have a richer
sense of the past; past events live on in the present. Cohen calls collectivist,
polychronic cultures high-context cultures. Individualistic, monochronic cultures are then
low-context.</p>

<p>Cohen suggests that supposedly universal models of negotiation may instead reflect an
individualistic, monochronic culture. Models which take an instrumental approach to
negotiation, which emphasize separating people from issues, and which prioritize creating
efficient, maximally beneficial outcomes, may seem foreign to cultures that place primary
value in human relationships and have a less urgent sense of time. Not every issue is
negotiable. Which issues are considered to be open to negotiation and which are not often
depends upon cultural factors. National pride and the necessity of equal treatment are
non-negotiable issues for most countries. Often a reaffirmation of national pride or
status is required in order to bring a nation into negotiations. Collectivist cultures may
be especially sensitive to perceived slights or insults.</p>

<p>Most cultures will be extremely reluctant to negotiate sovereignty issues. However
different cultures focus their need for sovereignty in different areas. Often past events
come to symbolize wounded national pride. Being associated with such events can provoke
stiff resistance. Many nations' senses of sovereignty rest in maintaining their cultural
traditions. States which were once under colonial rule are often sensitive to anything
reminiscent of colonialism. The presence of foreign military, for example, may be a
non-negotiable issue to such states. North American and Northern European nations tend to
treat matters of human rights as non-negotiable issues. Many of the other nations do not
attach such basic importance to human rights. The list of human rights set forth in the UN
Declaration of Human Rights has been criticized as reflecting the individualistic cultural
bias of the West. Some people have argued that these individualistic rights are less
applicable or appropriate to collectivist cultures.</p>

<p>Stages of Negotiation</p>

<p>Cohen explores the effects of cultural differences in the four different phases of the
negotiation process. The phases Cohen identifies are the preparation phase, and the
beginning, middle and end phases of negotiations. Cohen notes that the various ways in
which the negotiation process is described and divided are themselves culturally loaded.
Cohen's divisions are made simply for the sake of convenience, and are not meant to refer
to necessarily distinct stages.</p>

<p>For high-contrast negotiators, the preparatory stage focuses on building personal
relationships with the other side. Accustomed to acting within a rich network of
interdependent relations, high-context negotiators start by attempting to build such a
network with the opponent. Low-context cultures see issues as separable from personal
relations, and prefer to act in relatively anonymous ways. High-context cultures also tend
to take a long term view, focusing on cultivating and improving the parties' relationship.
Low-context cultures tend to have a more short term focus on the issue at hand.</p>

<p>Maintaining face (reputation or honor) is generally more important in high-context
cultures than in low-context. Because of the importance of maintaining face, high-context
negotiators generally try to minimize uncertainty and to prevent crises, confrontations,
and surprises. Being caught by surprise is likely to result in a loss of face for someone.
Similarly someone is likely to lose in a confrontation, with the attending loss of face.
Low-context cultures are less concerned with issues of face, and so are more open to
uncertainty, competition and confrontation. The beginning phase of negotiations can be
complicated by differences between hierarchical and egalitarian cultures. Egalitarian
cultures assume negotiations will proceed by the parties taking turns presenting their
concerns, and reciprocating initiatives in kind. Low- context negotiators tend to open
negotiations by first setting forth their position, assuming that the other side will
respond by stating their opposing position. Low-context cultures view declaring a opening
position to be risky and confrontational. The opening positions reveal the party's
interests. When this statement of positions is not reciprocated it gives the reticent
party an advantage. Hierarchical cultures may view the parties' relationship as that of
supplicant to superior, and so be &quot;quite happy to demand one-sided concessions in
payment of a supposed moral debt or as the duty of the stronger party.&quot;[p. 84].
Cultures also differ in their preference for agreement on specifics or on general
principles. Low-context negotiators are likely to rely on the factual-inductive mode of
persuasion, which focuses on examining the facts at hand and crafting a conclusion to fit
those facts. High context negotiators may prefer the axiomatic-deductive mode of
persuasion, which seeks agreement on general principles and then applies those principles
to the case at hand. </p>

<p>Different cultures may have different expectations as to what should occur during the
middle phase of negotiations, and how much time this phase should take. Low context
cultures such as the U.S. expect that the middle phase will be a period of bargaining, a
process of trade-offs and concessions in which the parties gradually converge on a shared
position. Many high context cultures see such a process of &quot;haggling&quot; as
appropriate to price negotiations, but inappropriate to matters of principle. High status
individuals do not lower themselves to haggle over small points. Polychronic cultures are
usually willing to draw out the middle phase. Monochronic cultures are usually in more of
a hurry to reach an agreement. Monochronic cultures are often at some disadvantage when
negotiating with polychronic cultures, since their greater sense of urgency will prompt
them to make greater concessions in order to close the deal quickly. </p>

<p>Different cultural approaches to authority can also complicate the middle phase.
Collectivist cultures tend to base authority relations on the father-child model.
Authority is centralized, hierarchical, and tends to be absolute. Individualist cultures
tend to disperse power and authority, and to encourage questions and even challenges to
authority. The American system of governmental checks and balances is typical of a
individualist culture. Difficulties have often arisen as negotiators from collectivist
cultures over-estimate the power and domestic authority of the U.S. President. Japan is an
anomaly among collectivist cultures, in that political decision-making relies on
consensus.</p>

<p>Different cultures favor different means of negotiation and persuasion. The emphasis on
personal relationships and group harmony in high context cultures means that persuasion
focuses on cultivating a close, trusting relationship with the other side. High context
cultures are generally uncomfortable with overt aggression, confrontation, and adversarial
styles of interaction. Low context cultures find facts and reasoned arguments to be more
persuasive, and tend to favor a more direct, explicit and even aggressive style of
communication. </p>

<p>Low context cultures prefer direct communication, while high context cultures are
generally more indirect, relying on strong personal relationships to support mutual
understandings. Cohen notes that &quot;a striking feature of collectivistic, high context
speakers...is their dislike of the negative; a direct contradiction is invariably
avoided.&quot;[p. 113] When pressed for a direct answer, high context negotiators may
resort to expressions of polite agreement which are without substance. Or they may offer
ambiguous answers. Misunderstandings often result from such politeness being mistaken for
substantive agreement. Nonverbal communication also varies widely from culture to culture,
as does the acceptability of displays of emotion. High context cultures employ, and may be
particularly moved by, symbolic gestures.</p>

<p>As noted above, monochronic cultures, with their perpetual sense of urgency, tend to
rush the end phase of negotiations. In particular, low context negotiators tend to
overlook the importance of presenting face-saving alternatives when high context parties
are involved. For a proposal to be acceptable in a high context culture, it must not only
meet the parties material interests, it must also be presented in such a way as to
preserve the prestige and status of each party. High context negotiators may reject even
materially favorable proposals if agreeing would involve a significant loss of face.
Conversely, symbolic gains may make a materially unfavorable proposal acceptable. One way
to save face is to rely on informal, unwritten agreements, since these can be repudiated
should they become too embarrassing. This however runs counter to the low context
preference for specific, explicit, written agreements. </p>

<p>Conclusions</p>

<p>Cohen concludes his study with the following general suggestions for low context
negotiators when facing high context cultures. Study the history and language of the other
culture. Begin to cultivate a warm personal relationship with the other side's negotiators
even before negotiations start. Do not assume the other side interprets things in the same
way that you do. Be alert and sensitive to nonverbal or indirect communication, and be
aware of your own nonverbal cues. Be aware of and respect the importance of maintaining
face. Fit your negotiating strategy to the opponent's cultural needs, haggling when
appropriate or starting from general principles. Compromising in the face of an opponent's
intransigence may simply confuse the situation, since their stubbornness is often
calculated to make you reveal your bottom line. Low context negotiators must cultivate
patience. Finally, agreements must be presented in a form which preserves face all around.</p>
