<p>Joseph Nye, Jr., &quot;International Conflicts After the Cold War,&quot; in Managing
Conflict in the Post-Cold War World: The Role of Intervention. Report of the Aspen
Institute Conference, August 2-6, 1995, (Aspen, Colorado: Aspen Institute, 1996) pp.
63-76.</em></p>

<p>Nye explores the nature and causes of global, regional and communal conflicts. He also
evaluates various approaches to conflict prevention.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>The Concert of Europe maintained equilibrium among European nations after Napoleon's
defeat. It included former adversaries, as well as former allies. In time, the Concert
broke up as newly democratic nations refused to cooperate with older monarchies. The break
up of the Concert led, in part, to World War I.</p>

<p>Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations followed the first world war. The harsh
treaty terms stirred up unrest in Germany. Weak enforcement of the Treaty then allowed the
unrest to turn into aggression. The League requirement for consensus in order to act made
it unable to respond to member nation's aggression. The failure of these institutions led
in part to the Second World War.</p>

<p>United Nations, NATO and the Warsaw Pact defined the international system during the
Cold War. During this time, the international system took on a bipolar character which
inadvertently suppressed more regional or nationalistic conflicts. The system has been
effective in preventing violent global conflicts.</p>

<h3>Sources of Great Power Conflict</h3>

<p>There are two general approaches to understanding the causes of international conflict.
Realists argue that &quot;wars arise from the efforts of states to acquire power and
security in an anarchic world.&quot;[p. 66] Realism implies a pessimistic view of the
usefulness of international institutions in preventing conflicts. Strong international
institutions can only exist when there is sufficient agreement among the great powers to
allow them to exist. Disharmony among great powers makes strong international institutions
impossible.</p>

<p>Liberals argue that conflicts &quot;are determined not only by the balance of power,
but by the domestic structure of states, their values, identities and cultures and
international institutions for conflict resolution.&quot;[p. 66] Liberalism supports
trade, since trade makes nations more interdependent, and so less likely to go to war.
Liberals also note the democratic nations almost never war against one another. </p>

<p>Nye argues that neither view is adequate on its own. By drawing upon elements of both
perspectives, Nye describes two sources of great power conflict. First, power transitions
often lead to conflict. Declining nations may attempt to put down rising competitors.
Sensing weakness, growing nations may attack declining ones to secure a more favorable
place in the international system. The present era is one of dramatic power transitions.
However, Nye argues that &quot;the United States is the only true superpower, with global
assets in all the dimensions of power.&quot;[p. 67] Were the U.S. in decline, great powers
conflict would be more likely. As it stands the U.S.'s enduring and clearly superior
position tends to stabilize the international system.</p>

<p>Second, the nature of power and the ways in which power is exercised, play important
roles in causing or preventing conflicts. Nye argues against the liberal views that
economic power has not eclipsed military power in international importance. However, the
use of military force has become both more expensive and less effective. Nye points out
that, &quot;Rising powers have fewer incentives for territorial aggression than they have
had throughout most of history because the route to prestige, power and economic success
in the modern era lies in high technology production and human capital.&quot;[p. 68]</p>

<p>At present, the nature of power and of power transitions makes military conflict
between the great powers highly unlikely. Adding to this stability is the fact that Europe
and Japan, two leading powers, are both democratic and closely allied to the U.S. Nye says
that &quot;shared values, stable expectations, and interlocking institutions have become
so powerful among these three power centers that wars among them...are
unthinkable.&quot;[p. 69]</p>

<p>Other great powers are less stable. In the post-Cold War era both Russia and China are
changing unpredictably. Nye argues that &quot;efforts by the democratic great powers to
engage China and Russia in the international community and to urge them to make their
intentions and military forces transparent are the best means of limiting the potential
for conflicts.&quot;[p. 69] This policy has seen some success with China. China has signed
on to the Nonproliferation Treaty. China also participates in several regional
multinational groups. Engagement with Russia seems even more promising.</p>

<p>Nye compares this engagement approach with the early Concert of Europe. And just as the
Concert was undermined by domestic changes of its member nations, Nye warns that domestic
changes within Russia or China could threaten great power stability. Even so, the author
concludes that &quot;a strong counter- balancing coalition of democratic great powers,
nuclear deterrence, and the limited benefits of territorial conquest would continue to
make direct great power conflict unlikely.&quot;[p. 70] </p>

<h3>Regional Conflicts</h3>

<p>Regional conflicts seem more likely than great power conflicts. Regional conflicts
occur when one nation attempts to establish regional hegemony. Such conflict will tend to
draw the participation of the great powers. However, Nye argues that the great powers will
likely be united in their view of regional aggressors as threats to international
stability. Confronting united great power opposition, aggressors will find few allies. </p>

<p>A certain number of states will be willing to go it alone, however. When regional
military conflict occurs, great powers must act to contain the threat and put down the
aggression. Currently Iran, Iraq, and North Korea pose the greatest likelihood of regional
conflict. Allied great power forces have proven successful at putting down Iraqi
aggression, and deterring further aggression. The U.S. in particular must maintain its
military capacity to respond to such regional conflicts. </p>

<h3>Communal Conflicts</h3>

<p>Communal conflicts occur at three levels. They may involve transnational identities,
for example Islam. They may turn on national identities. Or they may exploit subnational
identities, such as particular religious or linguistic groups.</p>

<p>The globalized economy has undermined states' sovereignty and independence, and so
undermined the power and legitimacy of many governments. Economic changes have also
threatened many group identities and communities. Such groups &quot;have become
susceptible to the parochial political appeals of political, national, and ethnic
demagogues who hope to seize power in states whose governments have been weakened by the
collapse of communism or the ebb and flow of the global economy.&quot;[p. 72] States which
lack a strong central government are also at risk for communal conflict. Modern
communications makes such appeals more effective. In many cases comparatively minor
differences have been exaggerated into the grounds for bloody conflict. </p>

<p>Nye argues that two dynamics give rise to communal conflicts in such weakened nations.
First, &quot;established mechanisms for mediating conflicts lose force in delegitimized
states.&quot;[p. 73] Second, ethnic identities are seen as offering alternative grounds of
legitimacy. </p>

<p>The democratic great powers are not directly at risk from communal conflicts. However,
via modern communications and media, communal conflicts do have a domestic effect on the
democratic great powers. News of human suffering encourages support for intervention. News
of soldiers wounded, killed or taken hostage encourages public support for withdrawal.
Participants on both sides of such conflicts often seek to exploit this effect. Moreover,
such sympathy-based motivation produces uneven and changeable policies among the outside
nations. Together these result in &quot;difficulty for the leading democracies of engaging
in consistent, coordinated, and long-term approaches to communal conflicts.&quot;[p. 74] </p>

<p>Communal conflicts are the most common type of conflict in the post-Cold War era.
Although communal conflicts are generally less devastating than global or regional
conflicts, they are still very problematic. First, most existing international
institutions have been designed to manage interstate conflicts. Communal conflicts may be
internal or cut across state lines and so are difficult for such institutions to manage.
Second, communal conflicts have the potential to escalate horizontally throughout the
region, by &quot;the involvement of affiliated ethnic groups that spread across borders,
the sudden flood of refugees into neighboring states, or the use of neighboring
territories to ship weapons to combatants.&quot;[p. 74] Communal conflicts also have the
potential to escalate in intensity and violence.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>Realists describe conflicts in terms of power balance, military capabilities and
territorial interests. Currently these factors favor a stable system of regional and
global conflict deterrence. The liberal approach to conflicts seems to be more helpful in
understanding the remaining communal conflicts. Such conflicts are driven by domestic
issues, and by identity, culture and value conflicts. </p>

<p>The liberal analysis of conflicts sees a significant role for international
institutions in conflict management. Current international institutions need to be
strengthened and new approaches developed. Institutions which allow for both multilateral
and unilateral interventions are needed.</p>
