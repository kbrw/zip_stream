<hr>

<p>Morton Deutsch, The Resolution of Conflict.&nbsp; New Haven CT, Yale University Press
1973.</p>

<p>Note:&nbsp; When we were just beginning to investigate the topic of intractable
conflict, I read this book and found it to be the most helpful and insightful book on the
topic I had yet read.&nbsp; This remains the case--if I had to choose one book to
recommend on the theory of intractable (and tractable) conflicts--this would be my first
choice.&nbsp; What follows are my detailed notes taken from this reading.&nbsp; They do
not cover the entire book with equal emphasis, but rather, pull out the key ideas Deutsch
has which relate to the topics were are investigating in this project.</p>

<hr>
<font FACE="Trebuchet MS">

<p>The main thrust of Deutsch</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">s inquiry, is</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">the conditions that determine whether a conflict will be resolved with
constructive or destructive consequences.</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS"> (p. 8). </p>

<p><strong>Variables which effect the course of the conflict</strong> (and therefore
determine the constructiveness or destructiveness of the outcomes include:</p>

<p>(1) the characteristics of the parties including their values and motivations;
aspirations and objectives; physical, intellectual and social resources; beliefs about
conflict; strategy and tactics; and power relationships; </p>

<p>(2) their prior relationship to one another including attitudes, beliefs and
expectations about each other, degree of polarization and trust; </p>

<p>(3) the nature of the issue giving rise to the conflict including its scope, rigidity,
motivational significance, formulation, periodicity, etc.; </p>

<p>(4) the social environment within which the conflict occurs including the facilities
and restraints, encouragements and deterrents, social norms, institutional conflict
moderating processes; </p>

<p>(5) the interested audiences to the conflict including their relationships to the
parties and to each other, their interests, their characteristics; </p>

<p>(6) strategy and tactics employed by the parties including their legitimacy or
illegitimacy, the use of positive and negative incentives such as promises and rewards or
threats and punishments, use of coercion versus freedom of choice, openness and veracity
of communication and sharing of information, degree of creditability, degree of
commitment, types of motives appealed to; </p>

<p>(7) the consequences of the conflict to each of the participants and the other
interested parties including immediate gains and losses, precedence established,
short-term effects, long-term effects, effects on reputations of the parties.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Like Simmel (1955) and Coser (1956) Deutsch assumes that conflict is potentially of
personal and social value.&nbsp; The benefits of conflict, he says, include preventing
stagnation, stimulating interest and curiosity, the airing of problems, the development of
solutions, the root of personal and social change, conflict tests, individuals, it
demarcates groups from each other and helps establish groups and personal identities,
external conflict fosters internal cohesiveness. </p>

<p>Quoting Coser (156, pp. 154-55): <font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font>Conflict
can have a stabilizing and integrative functions for the relationship. It enables social
structures to readjust by eliminating sources of dissatisfaction and eliminating the
causes for disassociation. Conflict frequently helps to revitalize norms; or it
contributes to the emergence of new norms. Thus it is a mechanism for adjusting norms to
new conditions. Internal conflict can also help maintain and continually readjust the
balance of power between groups.<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> </p>

<p>Page 9, <font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font>Since the outbreak of a conflict
indicates a rejection of a previous accommodation between parties, once the respective
power of the contenders has been ascertained through conflict, a new equilibrium can be
established and the relationship can proceed on this new basis.<font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> </p>

<p>Although the objective characteristics of conflict is important, that alone does not
&nbsp; determine whether a conflict will be productive or destructive. Even under the most
unfavorable objective conditions, conflicts can be handled in constructive ways. &nbsp;
Similarly, even the most favorable objective circumstances can lead to destructive
conflicts if certain psychological factors are present. </p>

<p>On page 17, Deutsch suggests another distinction between destructive and constructive
conflicts. These terms are easy to define at the extremes. Conflict has destructive
consequences if its participants are dissatisfied with the outcomes and they feel they
have lost as a result of the conflict. A conflict has productive consequences if the
participants are satisfied with the outcomes and feel they have gained as a result of the
conflict. The basic question to which this work is addressed is how to prevent conflict
from being destructive. Page 17, <font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font>the point is
not how to eliminate or prevent conflict but rather how to make it productive.<font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> This inquiry does not deal with situations of what
Deutsch calls pure conflict in which one side inevitably loses what the other gains;
rather he is interested in conflict where there is a mixture of cooperation and
competitive interests, and a variety of outcomes is possible: lose-lose, win-lose, or
win-win. Restating his thesis, he says he is investigating the conditions under which the
participants will evolve or a competitive relationship in a situation which permits
either.</p>

<p><strong>Deutsch's typology of conflicts</strong></p>

<p>On page 12, Deutsch sets out his own typology of conflicts which he likens to that set
out earlier by Boulding in 1962, Rapoport in 1960 and various articles in the first issues
of the <i>Journal of Conflict Resolution</i> 1957. His typology includes </p>

<p>( 1)vertical conflict, which is conflict that exists objectively and is perceived
accurately.&nbsp; It not contingent upon some easily altered feature of the environment. </p>

<p>(2) Contingent conflict, which is contingent upon an easily altered feature of the
environment. </p>

<p>(3) Displaced conflict, where the parties are arguing about the wrong thing. The
conflict being experienced is the manifest conflict, while the one that is not being
directly expressed is the underlying conflict. Frequently, the manifest conflict is a
symbol of the underlying conflict, but it is a safer way to express what is going on
because the underlying conflict is seen as too volatile or too dangerous to deal with
directly. Page 13: <font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font>Often manifest conflict can
only be resolved temporarily--unless the underlying conflict can only be resolved
temporarily--unless the underlying conflict is dealt with or unless the manifest conflict
can be separated from the underlying conflict and treated in isolation. On the other hand,
sometimes the resolution of an underlying conflict is expedited by dealing with it
initially in its safer, displaced forms, which often seem more approachable because they
are less cosmic in their applications than the underlying conflict.<font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> </p>

<p>(4) Misattributed conflict where the conflict is between the wrong parties and over the
wrong issues. </p>

<p>(5) Latent conflict, a conflict that should be occurring but is not. </p>

<p>(6) False conflict where there is no objective basis for a conflict at all. This occurs
when there is misperception or misunderstanding. These types of conflicts are not mutually
exclusive. </p>

<p><strong>Conflict Issues</strong></p>

<p>On page 15 and 16, Deutsch lays out five basic <strong>conflict issues</strong>. These
include (1) control over resources, (2) preference and nuisances, (3) value conflict, (4)
conflicts over beliefs about what is: facts, information, (5) the nature of the
relationship between the parties, domination conflicts. </p>

<p>Chapter 13: Factors Influencing the Resolution of Conflict</p>

<p>Deutsch starts by characterizing destructive conflicts. These conflicts have a tendency
to expand and escalate. Page 351: </font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">Destructive conflict is characterized by a tendency to expand and
escalate. As a result, such conflict often becomes independent of its initiating causes
and is likely to continue after these have become irrelevant or have been forgotten.
Expansion occurs along the various dimensions of the conflict: the size and the number of
the immediate issues involved; the number of motives and participants implicated on each
side of the issue; the size and number of the principles and precedents that are perceived
to be at stake; the costs that the participants are willing to bear in relation to the
conflict; the number of norms of moral conduct from which behavior toward the other side
is exempted; and the intensity of negative attitudes toward the other side.</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS"> </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">Deutsch goes on to quote Coleman (1957, p. 14) saying that
escalation can occur because of a </font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">Gresham</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">s Law of Conflict: the harmful and dangerous elements drive out those
which would keep the conflict within bounds.</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS"> As the scope of the conflict expands, there is an increasing
reliance, Deutsch says, upon power, threat, coercion and deception. There</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">s a move away from
persuasion, conciliation, minimization of differences and the enhancement of mutual
understanding and goodwill. Within each of the conflicting parties, there</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">s increasing pressure for
uniformity of opinion and a tendency for leadership to be taken over by the more extreme
groups who are better organized for combat and taken away from those that are more
conciliatory. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">Thus (p. 352), </font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">the tendency to escalate conflict results from the conjunction of
three interrelated processes: (1) competitive processes involved in the attempt to win the
conflict; (2) processes of misperception and biased perception; and (3) processes of
commitment arising out of pressures for cognitive and social consistency. These processes
give rise to a mutually reinforcing cycle of relations that generate actions and reactions
that intensify conflict.</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS"> </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">Opposing factors may serve to limit conflicts so that
escalation does not develop. These include (1)cooperative bonds; (2)cross-cutting
identifications; (3) common allegiances and memberships; (4) conflict limiting values,
institutions, procedures and groups; and (5) the salience and significance of the cost of
the escalating conflict. If these conflict limiting factors are weak, he says, it may be
difficult to prevent a competitive conflict from expanding its scope. Even if they are
strong, misjudgment and the pressures arising out of tendencies to be rigidly
self-consistent, may make it difficult to keep a competitive conflict encapsulated. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">On page 353, Deutsch lists main features of competitive
processes that tend to perpetuate and escalate conflicts. These include&nbsp; (1)
unreliable and impoverished communication between conflicting parties. (2) Competition
stimulates the view that a solution of the conflict can only be imposed by one side
through superior force, deception or cleverness. (3) Enhancement of one</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">s own power and
minimization of the other</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">s power becomes objectives. (4) Competition leads to suspicious
hostile attitude that increases the sensitivity to differences and threats, while
minimizing the awareness of similarities. This allows groups to treat the other in ways
that would not be acceptable to treat one</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">s own group members. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">(5) In addition to competitive effects, misjudgment and
misperception feed the escalation spiral. There</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">s a basic psychological principle that causes people to interpret
other</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">s actions
as hostile, while they interpret their own similar actions as benevolent. This alone
causes the conflict to spiral upward in intensity. There is often a parallel bias in what
is considered to be an equitable agreement for resolving the conflict because people think
that differential legitimacy should be differentially rewarded. Page 355, </font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">The biased perception of
what is a fair compromise makes agreement more difficult and thus extends conflict.</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS"> A related psychological
principle is the asymmetry between trust a suspicion. Trust when violated is more likely
to turn into suspicion then negated suspicion is to turn into trust. Similarly it is
easier to move from cooperation to competition then in the other direction. Also driving
the escalation spiral is a process of commitment. The pressure for self-consistency,
Deutsch says, may lead to an unwitting involvement in and intensification of conflict
because one</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">s
actions have to be justified to one</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">s self and to others. This explains U.S. involvement in Vietnam, pp.
356-7. Deutsch also points to the problem of situational entrapment in which people behave
in a way that is expected to cause one result but it actually causes the opposite. Yet
they continue to reinforce their initial behavior in an attempt to get what they wanted in
the first place. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">Nevertheless, destructive conflicts such as U.S. involvement
in Vietnam, can be brought to a conclusion once the costs of continuing the conflict
become so large that it is obviously senseless to continue. Unfortunately, this
senselessness becomes apparent to decision-makers much later then it does to others who do
not need to justify past decisions. Destructive conflict can also be aborted before
running its full course if there is a strong enough community or third party who can
compel the conflicting parties to end their violence. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">On page 359, Deutsch discusses the course of productive
conflict. The voluminous literature on social conflict, he says, neglects productive
conflict between groups, rather focusing on pathological conflict. Page 359: </font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">Apart from the writings of
people connected with the nonviolence movement, little attempt has been made to
distinguish between conflicts that achieve social change through a process that is
mutually rewarding to the parties involved in the conflict and one that is not. Yet,
change can take place either through a process of confrontation, which is costly to the
conflicting groups, or it can take place through a process of problem solving, which is
mutually rewarding to the conflicting groups.</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS"> </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">Deutsch assumes that the features of productive conflict
resolution are similar to those involved in creative thinking. Creative thinking involves
three key psychological elements These include (1) the arousal of an appropriate level of
motivation to solve the problem; (2) the development of the conditions that permit the
reformulation of the problem once an impasse has been reached; and (3) the concurrent
availability of diverse ideas that can be flexibly combined into novel and varied
patterns. On page 360 he says, </font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">one of the creative functions of conflict resides in its ability to
arouse motivation to solve a problem that might otherwise go unattended.</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS"> (p. 360) However, he
continues: </font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">acceptance
of the necessity for a change in the status quo, rather than a rigid, defensive adherence
to previously existing positions, is most likely, however, when the circumstances arousing
new motivations suggest courses of action that contain minimal threat to the social or
self-esteem of those who must change.</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS"> Quoting Stein 1968: The circumstances conductive to the creative
breaking-through of impasses are those that provide </font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">the individual with an
environment in which he does not feel threatened and in which he does not fell under
pressure. He is relaxed but alert</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS"> (p. 361). Deutsch says: </font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">Threat induces defensiveness and reduces both the tolerance of
ambiguity and the openness to the new and unfamiliar; excessive tension leads to a
primitivization and a stereotyping of thought processes.</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS"> Also citing Rokeach, </font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">threat and excessive
tension lead to the closed rather than open mind.</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">Also important to successful conflict resolution is the
availability of cognitive resources. Any factors that broaden the range of ideas and
alternatives cognitively available to the participants in a conflict will be useful. In
the last full paragraph on page 362, Deutsch argues that at the international, intergroup
and interpersonal levels, much more training is available in waging or suppressing
conflict then there is available in resolving conflict. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">Page 362, he defines cooperative problem solving; a process
in which conflict is viewed as a common problem in which the conflicting parties have the
joint interest of meeting a mutually satisfactory solution. There are a number of reasons
he says why a cooperative process is likely to lead to productive conflict resolution: (1)
Cooperative processes aid open and honest communication of relevant information between
participants; (2) It encourages the recognition of the legitimacy of the other</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">s interests and of the
necessity to search for a solution that is responsive to the needs of each side; (3) It
leads to a trusting friendly attitude, which increases sensitivity to similarities and
common interests, while minimizing differences; It stimulates a convergence of beliefs and
values. Cooperation tends to lead to what Deutsch calls </font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">benevolent misperception.</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS"> Cooperation tends to
minimize differences and enhance a perception of the other</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">s benevolence. This has a
dampening effect on conflict and makes escalation unlikely . </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">People can be committed to cooperation the same way they can
be committed to confrontation. Deutsch lays out what he calls, </font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">Deutsch</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">s Crude Law of Social
Relations.</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">
This law says, page 365, </font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">characteristic processes and effects elicited by a given type of
social relationship (cooperative or competitive) tend also to elicit that type of social
relationship.</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">
Thus power, coercion, threat and deception result from and elicit a competitive
relationship. Similarly, mutual problem solving, persuasion, openness and mutual
enhancement elicit, and also are elicited by, a cooperative orientation. This can be
summarized by saying </font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">cooperation breeds cooperation, while competition breeds competition</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS"> (p. 367). </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">Summarizing on page 368, a conflict orientation that
highlights mutual interests, seeks enhancement of mutual power and defines the conflict as
a mutual problem is more likely to take a constructive course, then an orientation that
emphasizes antagonistic interests, seeks to maximize power differentials and defines the
conflict in win-lose terms. Similarly, a trusting, friendly orientation to the other with
a positive interest in the other</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">s welfare and a readiness to respond helpfully to the other</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">s needs and requests is
less likely to lead to a destructive conflict then a suspicious, hostile attitude with a
readiness to exploit the other</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">s needs and weaknesses and a negative responsiveness to the other</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">s request. A perceived
similarity in beliefs and values, a sense of common bonds and interest between one</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">s self and the other is
more likely to produce a constructive conflict, then a sense of opposed beliefs and
values. Full, open and honest communication, free of monovalent distortion, which is
persuasive rather then cohesive in form and intent, is less likely to lead to a
destructive conflict then blocked, misleading or autistic communication. Deutsch suggests
that the prior relationship between the parties is also important. If they had a
successful cooperative relationship in the past, it makes it more likely that such
cooperation will continue. On the other hand, failed attempts at cooperation make
additional attempts unlikely. Past experiences of costly competitive conflict may or may
not enhance the probability of cooperation in the future. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">Other factors which influence the constructive or destructive
character of the conflict include (1) conflict size; (2) centrality of the issues
involved; (3) rigidity of the issues; (4) number of issues involved and their
interconnectedness; (5) the consensus on issue importance; and (6) the degree to which the
conflict is acknowledged. Conflict Size: larger conflicts are more likely to take a
destructive course then smaller ones. Here conflict size is defined as </font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">being equal to the expected
difference in the value of the outcomes that a person would receive if he wins, compared
with the values that he would receive if the other wins the conflict</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS"> (p. 369). Thus to minimize
the size of a conflict one should try to diminish the perceived opposition in interests
and beliefs through controlled communication, see Burton 1969; role reversal (Cohen 1950,
Rapoport 1960); or encounter group exercises (Schutz 1967). All of these techniques allow
parties to see how much they have in common and allow them to view their differences in
terms of their similarities. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">The assumption is also made that through improved open, full
direct communication, misunderstandings can be eliminated and perceived differences will
decrease. Occasionally, however, removal of misunderstandings sharpens the awareness of
conflicting interests or beliefs. An awareness that might have been clouded by benevolent
misunderstandings, see Johnson 1967. Fisher (1964) suggested the importance of issue
control. Quoting Deutsch, p. 370: </font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">Controlling the importance of what is perceived to be at stake in a
conflict may be one of the most effective ways of preventing the conflict from taking a
destructive course.</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS"> In general, he says, short-term, localized conflicts are much easier
to resolve constructively then conflicts that are defined in terms of principles,
precedents, rights, so that the issues transcend time and space and are generalized beyond
the specific actions to personalities, groups, races, or other large social units or
categories. Page 370: </font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">Thus when a quarrel starts to center on personalities or group
memberships rather than specific actions, it usually takes a nonproductive turn.
Similarly, when a discussion focuses on rights or principles rather than on what is
specifically taking place at a given time and locale, it is not likely to be fruitful.</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS"> </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">There is an opposing principle, however, that keeping the
conflict small may facilitate maintenance of the status quo. Therefore those attempting to
bring about social change may try to enlarge a conflict so that it becomes the focus of
concerned attention. Another problem leading to destructive conflicts is issue rigidity.
Rigidity may be a function of the people involved or the issue itself. Page 371: </font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">Certain issues are less
conducive to conflict resolution that other. </font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">&lt;</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">Greater power over the other,</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS"> victory over the other,</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS"> having more status than the other</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS"> are rigid definitions of
conflict, since it is impossible on any given issue for each party in conflict to have
outcomes that are superior to the other</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">s.</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS"> The more central the issue is to the individual the more apt it is to
be defined in a rigid way. Thus conflicts over issues that are considered to be central by
both sides are often the most irreconcilable ones. Winner-takes-all conflicts are
especially difficult to resolve. Therefore, if a single conflict can be broken down into a
number of separate issue so that it is no longer an all-or-nothing matter, conflict is
less likely to take a destructive course. Also helpful is a lack of consensus on the
importance of different issues. If one side thinks one thing is more important and the
other thinks another thing is more important, that will facilitate the resolution of a
conflict between those two issues. Regarding consciousness of the issues, unacknowledged
or unconscious conflict is harder to resolve then recognized conflict. Similarly, conflict
between parties who do not recognize the existence and legitimacy of one another is more
likely to be destructive then if they do. There are two major forms of unacknowledged
conflict--displaced conflict and latent conflict. Other factors which lead to the
destructiveness of conflicts include the ideologies, personalities, social positions, and
personal resources of the conflicting parties. In general, similarities in beliefs,
attitudes and values are usually conducive to compatibility and hence to cooperative
resolutions of conflicts. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">Third parties can either play a helpful or a harmful role. At
times third parties can aggravate or instigate a conflict unwittingly. At other times
however the mire intervention of an outsider may serve to unify the conflicting parties
against the outsider. The parties may agree that it is their private conflict and both may
fear or resent the intrusion of an outsider into their private affairs. Therefore, by
intervention the third party can activate and make more salient the cohesive bonds between
the conflicting parties that they were not aware of before. Third parties can also use
prestige and power to encourage resolution by helping provide problem solving resources to
expedite the discovery of a mutually satisfactory resolution. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">Discussing the regulation of conflict, Deutsch says,: </font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">It is evident that conflict
can be limited and controlled by institutional forms (e.g., collective bargaining, the
judicial system), social roles (mediators, conciliators, referees, judges, policemen),
social norms (fairness, justice, equality, nonviolence, integrity of communication, etc.),
rules for conducting negotiations (when to initiate and terminate negotiations, how to set
an agenda, how to present demands, etc.), and specific procedures (hinting versus explicit
communication, public versus private sessions, etc.).</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS"> All of these social
structures may be aimed at regulating how force is employed. Or attempting to ascertain
the basic power relations without resort to a power struggle as occurs in collective
bargaining or international negotiations. Or it may be oriented toward removing power as a
basis for determining the outcome of conflict, as is often the case in judicial processes.
</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">For conflict regulation to develop, several preconditions are
required. First of all, Deutsch says, conflicting parties must themselves be organized.
Here he quotes Dahrendorf (1959, p. 226): </font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">So long as conflicting forces are diffuse, incoherent aggregates,
regulation is virtually impossible.</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS"> Second, p. 378: </font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">Each party to a conflict must be will to recognize the legitimacy of
the other party and be committed to accepting the outcome of the regulated conflict, even
if it is considered t be unfavorable to his interest.</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS"> Third, recurrent conflicts
are more likely to be regulated then unprecedented conflicts. Finally, p. 378: </font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">The regulation of conflict
is most likely to develop when both sides to a conflict are part of a common community.</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS"> Deutsch then examines when
adherence to rules is likely to occur. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">He hypothesizes that adherence to rules is more likely when
(1) the rules are known; (2) the rules are clear, unambiguous and consistent; (3) the
rules are not perceived to be biased against one</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">s own interest; (4) the other adheres to the rules; (5) violations are
quickly known by significant others; (6) there is significant social approval for
adherence and significant social disapproval for violations; (7) adherence to the rules
has been rewarding in the past; and (8) one would like to be able to employ the rules in
the future. Negotiations involving conflict of interests are more likely to have
acceptable outcomes for the parties involved to the extent that they take place in the
context of cooperative relations. Harmonious relations are less likely to occur, p. 381,
when one or both sides (1) feels that their existence or their rights are threatened; (2)
think that their survival is endangered; (3) are torn by internal factionalism; (4) have
little local autonomy; (5) are constantly subjected to changing conditions. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">Third party roles are as follows (1) helping the conflicting
parties identify and confront the issues in conflict; (2) helping provide favorable
circumstances and conditions for confronting the issues; (3) helping remove the blocks and
distortions in the communication process so the mutual understanding may develop; (4)
helping establish such norms for rational interaction as mutual respect, open
communication, the use of persuasion rather than coercion and the desirability of reaching
a mutually satisfying agreement; In other words, p. 384, </font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">the conflicting parties are
helped to fight fairly, that is, to fight under rules that prevent them from hitting one
another below the belt or from yelling foul when a fair but intense exchange is taking
place</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS"> (Bach
and Wyden 1969). Fair rules of procedure are valuable in any kind of discussion but are
vital in conflicts. The essence of fair rules is that they are unbiased. P. 385: </font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">Although norms that
encourage fair rules for fighting are useful in limiting destructiveness of a struggle,
they are often not sufficient to encourage cooperative negotiations. The latter are
facilitated by norms that emphasize recognition of the other</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">s legitimacy, mutual
respect, the desirability of a mutually satisfying agreement, and open communication.</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS"> Third parties can do much
to promote a social framework that is conducive to cooperative negotiations by enhancing
all of these factors. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">Third parties can also foster cooperation by helping
determine what kinds of solutions are possible and making suggestions about possible
solutions by helping make a workable agreement acceptable to the parties in a conflict and
by helping make the negotiators an agreement that is arrived at seem prestigious and
attractive to interested audiences, especially the groups represented by the negotiators.
Third parties can help in resolving disputes constructively to the extent that they are
known, readily accessible, prestigious, skilled, impartial and discrete. On p. 389,
Deutsch lists types of influence procedures that are likely to elicit resistance and
alienation. These include illegitimate techniques, which violate the values and norms of
the other side; negative sanctions, such as punishments and threats; sanctions that are
inappropriate in kind; or influence that is excessive in magnitude. Deutsch then considers
what could be done by low power groups to enhance their power relationships. In order to
be most effecting, Deutsch suggests (1) the low-power party make a clear statement of the
specific actions and changes being requested of the high-power party; (2) the low-power
party should express an appreciation of the difficulties, problems, and costs that the
high-power party would incur if he complies with the low-power parties wishes. This
appreciation should be combined with an expressed willingness to cooperate to overcome
these difficulties and costs; (3) a depiction of the values and benefits that the
high-power party will realize by cooperating with the other party; (4) a statement of the
negative, harmful consequences that are inevitable for the high-power groups values and
objectives if the low-power groups is not responded to positively; and (5) an expression
of the power and resolve of the low-power group to act effectively and unwaveringly to
induce the high-power group to come to an acceptable agreement. A message that contains
all of the above elements strongly commits the low-power group to his objective. Yet it
suggests the means of obtaining it are flexible and potentially responsive to the others
group</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">s needs.
However, rage or fear in the low-power group often makes it impossible for the members of
the group to communicate a message of the sort described. Rage leads to an emphasis on
destructive, cohesive techniques and precludes offers of authentic cooperation. Fear, on
the other hand, weakens the commitment to the steps necessary to induce a change, unless
it is the creditability regarding the idea that compliance will be withdrawn if change
does not occur, p. 393. Both rage and fear are debilitation emotions. Rooted in the sense
of helplessness and powerlessness. They</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">re associated with a state of dependency. The ability to offer and
engage in authentic cooperation presupposes an awareness that one is neither helpless nor
powerless even though one is at a relative disadvantage. Page 394: </font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">Unless one has the freedom
to choose not to cooperate, there can be no free choice to cooperate. Black power is thus
a necessity for black cooperation, black cooperation with blacks as well as with
whites...Black power does not, however, necessarily lead to cooperation. This is partly
because, in its origin and rhetoric, black power may be oriented against white power and
thus is likely to intensify the defensiveness of those with high power.</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS"> What can a low-power group
do in such situations? They must increase their relative power sufficiently to compel the
other side to negotiate. This is done by either of two means--increasing one</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">s own power or decreasing
the other</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">s
power. This is done by altering the resources that underlie power, which Deutsch lists on
the top of page 395 as being wealth, physical strength, organization, knowledge, skill,
trust, respect, and affection. Or one can modify the effectiveness with which the
resources of power are employed. Page 395: </font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS">Potential power may not be converted into effective power because
those who possess such power may not be aware of their power, or they may not be motivated
to use it, or they may use their power inefficiently and unskillfully so that much
potential power is wasted...Effective power depends upon the following key elements: (1)
the control or possession of resources to generate power; (2) the awareness of the
resources one possesses or controls; (3) the motivations to employ these resources to
influence others; (4) skill in converting the resources into usable power; and (5) good
judgement in employing this power so that its use is appropriate in type and magnitude to
the situation in which it is used.</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">In general, low-power groups lack control over resources,
such as money, guns and official position that are immediately related to economic,
military and political power. Their primary resources are discontented people and having
justice on their side. Utility of people is a function of their number, their personal
qualities and their social cohesion and social organization. Cohesion is attained by
working together on issues that are specific, immediate, and realizable. Pursuit of vague,
futuristic, grandiose objectives will not long sustain cohesiveness. Low-power groups
often have two other key assets that can be used to amplify their other
resources--discontent and the sense of injustice. These may be latent rather then
manifest. If it is latent, consciousness raising tactics are necessary precursors to the
development of group cohesion and social organization. Alinsky (1971, p. 152) points out: </font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">The basic tactic in warfare
against the Haves is a mass political jujitsu: the Have-Nots do not rigidly oppose the
Haves, but yield in such planned and skilled ways that the superior strength of the Haves
becomes their own undoing</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><font
FACE="Trebuchet MS"> (p. 397). In general, it is a mistake to think that a high-power
group is completely unified. Most groups have internal divisions and conflicts amongst
their members that can be exasperated by foster mutual suspicions and by playing one side
against the other. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">Page 398-9, Deutsch summarizes a number of Alinsky</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">s nonviolent techniques for
empowering the low-power group and disempowering the Haves. In summary on page 399 Deutsch
says: </font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">?</font><font FACE="Trebuchet MS">Over the
preceding several pages, I have discussed some of the strategies and tactics available to
low-power groups in their attempt to compel a resistant high-power group to agree to a
change in their relations...Apathetic resignation or destructiveness are not the only
responses available in the face of a contrary authority. It is possible to increase the
power of the have-nots by developing their personal resources, social cohesion, and social
organizations so that they have more influence. And in jujitsu fashion, it is possible for
the have-nots to employ some of the characteristics of the haves to throw the haves off
balance and reduce their effective opposition.</font></p>
