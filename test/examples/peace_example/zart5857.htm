<p>I. William Zartman and Saadia Touval, &quot;International Mediation in the Post-Cold
War Era,&quot; in Managing Global Chaos, eds. Chester Crocker, Fen Hampson and Pamela
Aall, (Washington, D.C.: United States Institute of Peace Press, 1996) p. 445-461.</em></p>

<p>&quot;Mediation is best thought of as a mode of negotiation in which a third party
helps the parties find a solution which they cannot find by themselves.&quot;[p. 446]
Zartman and Touval focus on mediation of violent, international, or civil conflicts. They
describe why third-parties decide to mediate, why and when conflicting parties accept
mediation, and what factors produce effective mediation.</p>

<h3>Why Third-Parties Mediate</h3>

<p>Third parties mediate based on their desire to make peace, and and their own
self-interest. Self-interest is the primary motivation for states. States are motivated by
both defensive and offensive interests. Defensive interests include promoting
international stability, and protecting the mediating nation's foreign interests. Often
nations will attempt to mediate a conflict in order to prevent rival powers from
intervening and expanding their influence. States may also fear being drawn into the
escalating conflict. When motivated by defensive interests, mediators often have some
stake in achieving particular outcomes.</p>

<p>When acting on the offense, states mediate conflicts in order to extend and increase
their own influence. For instance, successful mediation may earn the gratitude of other
nations. In such cases states usually have less interest in the content of the settlement.
As an example of how self-interest motivates third-parties, the authors offer the case of
U.S. mediation during and after the Cold War. During the Cold War, the U.S. was quick to
mediate international conflicts. By doing so, they extended their influence and blocked
expansion of Soviet influence. With the demise of the U.S.S. R., the U.S. has been less
eager to intervene.</p>

<p>Less powerful nations also act on defensive and offensive self-interests. In addition
smaller states may attempt mediation because they lack other foreign policy tools and as a
way avoiding being drawn in to the conflict as participants.</p>

<p>Non-state organizations generally emphasize peacekeeping as their main motive. However,
such groups are also motivated by an interest in upholding their reputations.
Intergovernmental organizations, such as the U.N., are influenced by the policies and
interests of their member states. The authors note that non-state organizations are often
&quot;interested in a particular outcome, not because it affects them directly, but
because they believe in its inherent desirability.&quot;[p. 450]</p>

<p>Parties to a conflict accept mediation when they believe it is in their best interests
to do so; that is, when they believe that &quot;mediation will gain an outcome that is
more favorable than the outcome gained by continued conflict.&quot;[p. 450] Similarly,
parties will accept mediation when rejecting it will result in greater harms. Parties may
fear incurring bad relations with the proposed mediating nation or international sanctions
if they refuse to negotiate. In addition, mediation may offer parties a way to negotiate
compromises without losing face. The mediator may also be seen as guarantor of the final
settlement.</p>

<h3>Mediation and Impartiality</h3>

<p>Touval has argued that &quot;If the acceptance of mediation is based on a cost-benefit
calculation, then the assumption that mediators must be perceived as impartial needs to be
revised.&quot;[p. 451] First, a preexisting good relationship with one of the parties may
aid effective communication and facilitate development of creative proposals. The
adversary party may see such a relationship as evidence that the mediator can effectively
pressure the other party into a settlement. The mediator's success and reputation rides on
their ability to deliver their ally into a settlement, and so again the adversary party
may be reassured that the mediator is strongly motivated to reach an acceptable
settlement. </p>

<p>The authors conclude that mediators need not be impartial to be accepted or effective.
Instead, they argue, &quot;mediators must be perceived as having an interest in achieving
an outcome acceptable to both sides and as being not so partial as to preclude such an
achievement.&quot;[p. 452] </p>

<h3>Timing</h3>

<p>To be successful, mediation must be undertaken at a time when the combatants are
willing to re-evaluate their policies. The authors describe two conditions under which
parties are inclined to re-evaluate their current activities. First is the mutually
hurting stalemate. Stalemate occurs when each side realizes that &quot;it is unable to
achieve its aims, resolve the problem or win the conflict by itself.&quot;[p. 452] The
stalemated condition must be costly, and unlikely to be broken in the foreseeable future.
The second situation is the impending crisis. This may be a situation where the parties
are facing a catastrophic escalation or have just barely avoided a catastrophic encounter.
When both parties realize that they cannot afford to suffer such catastrophe, they may
become willing to accept mediation. The skillful mediator will often manipulate the
parties perceptions of facing stalemate or crisis, in order to bring the parties to the
negotiating table.</p>

<p>The authors argue that the nature of effective timing creates difficulties for
preventative diplomacy. Parties to conflicts generally are not ready to reconsider their
policies in the early stages of a conflict, and so are not motivated to accept offers of
mediation. Third parties do not generally see low level or latent conflict as a threat to
their interests, and so are not motivated to offer their services as mediators. To be
effective, would-be mediators must learn to produce the perception of crisis or stalemate
at earlier stages in conflict. </p>

<h3>Mediation Techniques</h3>

<p>Mediators employ three basic techniques. In the early stages of negotiations mediators
tend to focus on assisting communication between the parties by carrying messages and
helping the parties to understand the messages conveyed. As negotiations get underway,
mediators may act as formulators. Parties turn to the mediator to provide a formula for
negotiations, that is, a &quot;common understanding of the problem and its solution or a
shared notion of justice to govern an outcome.&quot;[p. 454] Finally, mediators manipulate
the parties by using leverage in order to bring them into agreement.</p>

<p>Mediator power or leverage is paradoxically related to the parties power. Zartman and
Touval explain, &quot;The extent of the mediator's power depends entirely on the parties,
whose acceptance of a mediator depends entirely on its likelihood (potential power) of
producing an outcome acceptable to both sides.&quot;[p. 455] Mediators have five sources
of leverage. First and most common is persuasion, the ability to revise parties
perceptions of the risks and costs of conflict and the feasibility and desirability of
settlement. Second is the ability to extract an attractive proposal out of each side in
negotiations. Third, mediators may threaten to withdraw from negotiations. Such threats
assume that the parties still believe that mediated negotiations offer the best likelihood
of the most favorable outcome. Finally, mediators may use sanctions to worsen one or both
parties situation, and so to increase their motivation to settle. Or, where relevant
resources are available, the mediator may offer incentives to one or both sides.</p>

<p>All of these sources of leverage gain their power from the parties' needs. The stronger
the parties felt need for a settlement, the more leverage is available to the mediator.
The weaker the parties need to settle, the more the mediator must work to create the
perception of greater need, and the more the mediator must use external leverage in the
form of incentives and sanctions. For these reasons non-state organizations can be
effective in conflicts where the parties already feel the strong need to settle. States
are better equipped to mediate in cases which first require intensifying the parties' need
to settle. </p>

<h3>Ethical Dilemmas in Mediation</h3>

<p>Zartman and Touval conclude by describing three ethical dilemmas which arise in
international conflict mediation. First, mediators are often torn between the short-term
goal of ending bloodshed and the longer-term goal of settling the conflict. A cease-fire
may create a tolerable stalemate, and so end bloodshed at the cost of stalling settlement
negotiations.</p>

<p>Mediators may also be faced with a choice between pursuing &quot;an attainable
settlement that violates international norms, or [holding] out for one that is consistent
with the principles of justice adopted by the international community.&quot;[p. 459] On
the one hand people argue that some settlement is better than no settlement and continued
warfare. On the other people point out that unjust settlements rarely last, and that
tolerating such settlements may serve to undermine the foundations of international order
and security. The Bosnian conflict presents a stark example of this dilemma. </p>

<p>Finally, mediation facilitates settlement of conflicts, but does not insure
reconciliation or remove the causes of conflict. Mediators must follow through on
settlements, supporting implementation and holding the parties to their agreement. Yet to
be effective, mediators must avoid becoming embroiled in the conflict.</p>
