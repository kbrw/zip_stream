<p>Roger Fisher and William Ury, Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In,
(New York: Penguin Books, 1983).</p>

<p>In this classic text, Fisher and Ury describe their four principles for effective
negotiation. They also describe three common obstacles to negotiation and discuss ways to
overcome those obstacles.</p>

<p>Fisher and Ury explain that a good agreement is one which is wise and efficient, and
which improves the parties' relationship. Wise agreements satisfy the parties' interests
and are fair and lasting. The authors' goal is to develop a method for reaching good
agreements. Negotiations often take the form of positional bargaining. In positional
bargaining each part opens with their position on an issue. The parties then bargain from
their separate opening positions to agree on one position. Haggling over a price is a
typical example of positional bargaining. Fisher and Ury argue that positional bargaining
does not tend to produce good agreements. It is an inefficient means of reaching
agreements, and the agreements tend to neglect the parties' interests. It encourages
stubbornness and so tends to harm the parties' relationship. Principled negotiation
provides a better way of reaching good agreements. Fisher and Ury develop four principles
of negotiation. Their process of principled negotiation can be used effectively on almost
any type of dispute. Their four principles are 1) separate the people from the problem; 2)
focus on interests rather than positions; 3) generate a variety of options before settling
on an agreement; and 4) insist that the agreement be based on objective criteria. [p. 11]</p>

<p>These principles should be observed at each stage of the negotiation process. The
process begins with the analysis of the situation or problem, of the other parties'
interests and perceptions, and of the existing options. The next stage is to plan ways of
responding to the situation and the other parties. Finally, the parties discuss the
problem trying to find a solution on which they can agree. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separating People and Issues</p>

<p>Fisher and Ury's first principle is to separate the people from the issues. People tend
to become personally involved with the issues and with their side's positions. And so they
will tend to take responses to those issues and positions as personal attacks. Separating
the people from the issues allows the parties to address the issues without damaging their
relationship. It also helps them to get a clearer view of the substantive problem. </p>

<p>The authors identify three basic sorts of people problems. First are differences on
perception among the parties. Since most conflicts are based in differing interpretations
of the facts, it is crucial for both sides to understand the other's viewpoint. The
parties should try to put themselves in the other's place. The parties should not simply
assume that their worst fears will become the actions of the other party. Nor should one
side blame the other for the problem. Each side should try to make proposals which would
be appealing to the other side. The more that the parties are involved in the process, the
more likely they are to be involved in and to support the outcome.</p>

<p>Emotions are a second source of people problems. Negotiation can be a frustrating
process. People often react with fear or anger when they feel that their interests are
threatened. The first step in dealing with emotions is to acknowledge them, and to try to
understand their source. The parties must acknowledge the fact that certain emotions are
present, even when they don't see those feelings as reasonable. Dismissing another's
feelings as unreasonable is likely to provoke an even more intense emotional response. The
parties must allow the other side to express their emotions. They must not react
emotionally to emotional outbursts. Symbolic gestures such as apologies or an expression
of sympathy can help to defuse strong emotions.</p>

<p>Communication is the third main source of people problems. Negotiators may not be
speaking to each other, but may simply be grandstanding for their respective
constituencies. The parties may not be listening to each other, but may instead be
planning their own responses. Even when the parties are speaking to each other and are
listening, misunderstandings may occur. To combat these problems, the parties should
employ active listening. The listeners should give the speaker their full attention,
occasionally summarizing the speaker's points to confirm their understanding. It is
important to remember that understanding the other's case does not mean agreeing with it.
Speakers should direct their speech toward the other parties and keep focused on what they
are trying to communicate. Each side should avoid blaming or attacking the other, and
should speak about themselves. </p>

<p>Generally the best way to deal with people problems is to prevent them from arising.
People problems are less likely to come up if the parties have a good relationship, and
think of each other as partners in negotiation rather than as adversaries.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Focus on Interests</p>

<p>Good agreements focus on the parties' interests, rather than their positions. As Fisher
and Ury explain, &quot;Your position is something you have decided upon. Your interests
are what caused you to so decide.&quot;[p. 42] Defining a problem in terms of positions
means that at least one party will &quot;lose&quot; the dispute. When a problem is defined
in terms of the parties' underlying interests it is often possible to find a solution
which satisfies both parties' interests. </p>

<p>The first step is to identify the parties' interests regarding the issue at hand. This
can be done by asking why they hold the positions they do, and by considering why they
don't hold some other possible position. Each party usually has a number of different
interests underlying their positions. And interests may differ somewhat among the
individual members of each side. However, all people will share certain basic interests or
needs, such as the need for security and economic well-being.</p>

<p>Once the parties have identified their interests, they must discuss them together. If a
party wants the other side to take their interests into account, that party must explain
their interests clearly. The other side will be more motivated to take those interests
into account if the first party shows that they are paying attention to the other side's
interests. Discussions should look forward to the desired solution, rather than focusing
on past events. Parties should keep a clear focus on their interests, but remain open to
different proposals and positions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Generate Options</p>

<p>Fisher and Ury identify four obstacles to generating creative options for solving a
problem. Parties may decide prematurely on an option and so fail to consider alternatives.
The parties may be intent on narrowing their options to find the single answer. The
parties may define the problem in win-lose terms, assuming that the only options are for
one side to win and the other to lose. Or a party may decide that it is up to the other
side to come up with a solution to the problem.</p>

<p>The authors also suggest four techniques for overcoming these obstacles and generating
creative options. First it is important to separate the invention process from the
evaluation stage. The parties should come together in an informal atmosphere and
brainstorm for all possible solutions to the problem. Wild and creative proposals are
encouraged. Brainstorming sessions can be made more creative and productive by encouraging
the parties to shift between four types of thinking: stating the problem, analyzing the
problem, considering general approaches, and considering specific actions. Parties may
suggest partial solutions to the problem. Only after a variety of proposals have been made
should the group turn to evaluating the ideas. Evaluation should start with the most
promising proposals. The parties may also refine and improve proposals at this point.</p>

<p>Participants can avoid falling into a win-lose mentality by focusing on shared
interests. When the parties' interests differ, they should seek options in which those
differences can be made compatible or even complementary. The key to reconciling different
interests is to &quot;look for items that are of low cost to you and high benefit to them,
and vice versa.&quot;[p. 79] Each side should try to make proposals that are appealing to
the other side, and that the other side would find easy to agree to. To do this it is
important to identify the decision makers and target proposals directly toward them.
Proposals are easier to agree to when they seem legitimate, or when they are supported by
precedent. Threats are usually less effective at motivating agreement than are beneficial
offers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Use Objective Criteria</p>

<p>When interests are directly opposed, the parties should use objective criteria to
resolve their differences. Allowing such differences to spark a battle of wills will
destroy relationships, is inefficient, and is not likely to produce wise agreements.
Decisions based on reasonable standards makes it easier for the parties to agree and
preserve their good relationship.</p>

<p>The first step is to develop objective criteria. Usually there are a number of
different criteria which could be used. The parties must agree which criteria is best for
their situation. Criteria should be both legitimate and practical. Scientific findings,
professional standards, or legal precedent are possible sources of objective criteria. One
way to test for objectivity is to ask if both sides would agree to be bound by those
standards. Rather than agreeing in substantive criteria, the parties may create a fair
procedure for resolving their dispute. For example, children may fairly divide a piece of
cake by having one child cut it, and the other choose their piece. </p>

<p>There are three points to keep in mind when using objective criteria. First each issue
should be approached as a shared search for objective criteria. Ask for the reasoning
behind the other party's suggestions. Using the other parties' reasoning to support your
own position can be a powerful way to negotiate. Second, each party must keep an open
mind. They must be reasonable, and be willing to reconsider their positions when there is
reason to. Third, while they should be reasonable, negotiators must never give in to
pressure, threats, or bribes. When the other party stubbornly refuses to be reasonable,
the first party may shift the discussion from a search for substantive criteria to a
search for procedural criteria.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the Other Party Is More Powerful</p>

<p>No negotiation method can completely overcome differences in power. However, Fisher and
Ury suggest ways to protect the weaker party against a poor agreement, and to help the
weaker party make the most of their assets.</p>

<p>Often negotiators will establish a &quot;bottom line&quot; in an attempt to protect
themselves against a poor agreement. The bottom line is what the party anticipates as the
worst acceptable outcome. Negotiators decide in advance of actual negotiations to reject
any proposal below that line. Fisher and Ury argue against using bottom lines. Because the
bottom line figure is decided upon in advance of discussions, the figure may be arbitrary
or unrealistic. Having already committed oneself to a rigid bottom line also inhibits
inventiveness in generating options.</p>

<p>Instead the weaker party should concentrate on assessing their best alternative to a
negotiated agreement (BATNA). The authors note that &quot;the reason you negotiate is to
produce something better than the results you can obtain without negotiating.&quot;[p.
104] The weaker party should reject agreements that would leave them worse off than their
BATNA. Without a clear idea of their BATNA a party is simply negotiating blindly. The
BATNA is also key to making the most of existing assets. Power in a negotiation comes from
the ability to walk away from negotiations. Thus the party with the best BATNA is the more
powerful party in the negotiation. Generally, the weaker party can take unilateral steps
to improve their alternatives to negotiation. They must identify potential opportunities
and take steps to further develop those opportunities. The weaker party will have a better
understanding of the negotiation context if they also try to estimate the other side's
BATNA. Fisher and Ury conclude that &quot;developing your BATNA thus not only enables you
to determine what is a minimally acceptable agreement, it will probably raise that
minimum.&quot;[p. 111]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the Other Party Won't Use Principled Negotiation</p>

<p>Sometimes the other side refuses to budge from their positions, makes personal attacks,
seeks only to maximize their own gains, and generally refuses to partake in principled
negotiations. Fisher and Ury describe three approaches for dealing with opponents who are
stuck in positional bargaining. First, one side may simply continue to use the principled
approach. The authors point out that this approach is often contagious. </p>

<p>Second, the principled party may use &quot;negotiation jujitsu&quot; to bring the other
party in line. The key is to refuse to respond in kind to their positional bargaining.
When the other side attacks, the principles party should not counter attack, but should
deflect the attack back onto the problem. Positional bargainers usually attack either by
asserting their position, or by attacking the other side's ideas or people. When they
assert their position, respond by asking for the reasons behind that position. When they
attack the other side's ideas, the principle party should take it as constructive
criticism and invite further feedback and advice. Personal attacks should be recast as
attacks on the problem. Generally the principled party should use questions and strategic
silences to draw the other party out.</p>

<p>When the other party remains stuck in positional bargaining, the one-text approach may
be used. In this approach a third party is brought in. The third party should interview
each side separately to determine what their underlying interests are. The third party
then assembles a list of their interests and asks each side for their comments and
criticisms of the list. She then takes those comments and draws up a proposal. The
proposal is given to the parties for comments, redrafted, and returned again for more
comments. This process continues until the third party feels that no further improvements
can be made. At that point, the parties must decide whether to accept the refined proposal
or to abandon negotiations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the Other Party Uses Dirty Tricks</p>

<p>Sometimes parties will use unethical or unpleasant tricks in an attempt to gain an
advantage in negotiations such as good guy/bad guy routines, uncomfortable seating, and
leaks to the media. The best way to respond to such tricky tactics is to explicitly raise
the issue in negotiations, and to engage in principled negotiation to establish procedural
ground rules for the negotiation. </p>

<p>Fisher and Ury identify the general types of tricky tactics. Parties may engage in
deliberate deception about the facts, their authority, or their intentions. The best way
to protect against being deceived is to seek verification the other side's claims. It may
help to ask them for further clarification of a claim, or to put the claim in writing.
However, in doing this it is very important not to bee seen as calling the other party a
liar; that is, as making a personal attack. Another common type of tactic is psychological
warfare. When the tricky party uses a stressful environment, the principled party should
identify the problematic element and suggest a more comfortable or fair change. Subtle
personal attacks can be made less effective simply be recognizing them for what they are.
Explicitly identifying them to the offending party will often put an end to suck attacks.
Threats are a way to apply psychological pressure. The principled negotiator should ignore
them where possible, or undertake principled negotiations on the use of threats in the
proceedings. </p>

<p>The last class of trick tactics are positional pressure tactics which attempt to
structure negotiations so that only one side can make concessions. The tricky side may
refuse to negotiate, hoping to use their entry into negotiations as a bargaining chip, or
they may open with extreme demands. The principled negotiator should recognize this as a
bargaining tactic, and look into their interests in refusing to negotiate. They may
escalate their demands for every concession they make. The principled negotiator should
explicitly identify this tactic to the participants, and give the parties a chance to
consider whether they want to continue negotiations under such conditions. Parties may try
to make irrevocable commitments to certain positions, or to make-take-it-or-leave-it
offers. The principled party may decline to recognize the commitment or the finality of
the offer, instead treating them as proposals or expressed interests. Insist that any
proposals be evaluated on their merits, and don't hesitate to point out dirty tricks. </p>
