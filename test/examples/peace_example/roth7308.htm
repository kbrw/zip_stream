<p>Introduction</b> - The author says that it is often difficult to transfer knowledge and
insights gained from conflict resolution training and intervention methodologies to public
policy because those who possess such knowledge and insights are not always those in
power. He says that although multilateral, interactive negotiation planning and conflict
management policy-making are rare at high levels, it is still useful for policymakers on
all sides of a conflict to use these approaches unilaterally. He adds that the most
constructive solutions to intense conflict situations are those resulting from
intrinsically motivated efforts by both sides to seek mutually satisfactory solutions. In
this chapter, the author reviews the conflict between Israel and Egypt over the Taba area.
He then shows how the ARI Conflict Management Framework can be used to analyze the way in
which this conflict was handled, as well as alternative, more constructive, ways it could
have been handled given different framing of the dispute. </p>
<b>

<p>History of the Taba Dispute</b> - This dispute between Israel and Egypt was over the
locations of border markers on 900 square meters of sand between the two countries. This
dispute came in the wake of the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel in which Israel
agreed to withdraw from Sinai and a bilateral commission was established to demarcate the
new Israeli-Egyptian border. The Taba area, which is on the Red Sea along the Gulf of
Aqaba, was one of several areas in which border marker locations were disputed.
Negotiations between Egypt and Israel about the exact location of these markers failed.
The original dispute was then bogged down in a further dispute as to whether arbitration
or conciliation procedures should be followed, as provided in the Camp David peace treaty
of 1979. Talks were suspended in 1982, and it wasn't until 1986 that the two countries
finally agreed upon arbitration. In 1988, the arbitration commission finally decided in
favor of Egypt, after many delays and mutual threats between the two countries. Israel
then withdrew from Taba. </p>
<b>

<p>Adversarial Approach</b> - According to the author, Egypt and Israel's adversarial
approach to this dispute affected all phases of the negotiation over Taba and left both
countries feeling dissatisfied with the settlement process as well as the settlement
itself. </p>
<b>

<p>Adversarial Problem Definition</b> - Egypt and Israel framed this dispute in terms of
contradictory facts regarding the location of border markers. The conflict was framed as
zero-sum and thus the arbitrated settlement was a win lose outcome in which Egypt won and
Israel lost. </p>
<b>

<p>Adversarial Analysis of Causes</b> - The conflict over Taba was framed as a competition
between adversaries over a scarce resource. Each side attributed the dispute to the
other's negative dispositional traits, while claiming that its own behavior was motivated
by situation constraints. Egypt couldn't give up Taba without losing face both in the Arab
world and within Egypt itself. Egypt saw the Taba dispute as unwarranted Zionist
expansionism. Israel's invasion of Lebanon confirmed the Egyptian's distrust of Israel.
The Taba dispute was seen by Israel as evidence that Egypt was greedy and not really
interested in peace, since Israel had already given most of Sinai back to Egypt. Israel's
view of Egypt was confirmed by Egypt's siding with other Arab states which were in
conflict with Israel. </p>
<b>

<p>Adversarial Generation of Alternatives</b> (&quot;Distributive Bargaining&quot;)- The
eventual arbitrated settlement was a function of adversarial framing of the dispute by
Israel and Egypt. This kind of win-lose settlement is typical of results obtained by
traditional diplomacy in such disputes. The initial negotiations were characterized by
power-based, give-and-take bargaining ending in no compromise and leading to the necessity
of arbitration. The arbitration commission had little choice but to work within this
adversarial framework using precedents in international law to decide boundaries and then
hand over a win-lose verdict. Adversarial Implementation &amp; Implications - Although the
Taba dispute was settled nonviolently, both Israel and Egypt were unhappy with the
verdict. Israel threatened to seek to have the arbitration agreement canceled, but
eventually honored the decision under pressure from the U.S. to do so. Egypt was
dissatisfied because it felt that an undesirable precedent had been set for handling
future disputes. The result was a residue of bitterness on both sides, causing cold
Israeli-Egyptian relations in which one dispute was settled while the underlying conflict
was left unresolved. Unfortunately, this arbitrated settlement process did not lead to
increased motivation or skill on either side for pushing ahead with cooperative conflict
management initiatives.<b></p>

<p>Reflexive Approach</b> - The adversarial approach taken by both parties to this dispute
did not yield a truly satisfactory solution for either country because it did not address
either country' s underlying needs, fears, hopes, or constraints. The author speculates
about how a more satisfactory outcome might have been achieved if the two countries had
been able to broaden their range of options by taking what he calls a &quot;
reflexive&quot; approach to framing the problem. </p>
<b>

<p>Reflexive Problem Definition </b>- According to the author, a reflexive approach to the
Taba dispute would have revealed that the dispute was, in fact, being used by both sides
to prevent a summit between Mubarak and Peres, the respective leaders of Egypt and Israel.
According to his analysis, there were two reasons for this avoidance of a summit. First,
the Egyptians felt that normalization of relations with Israel would have damaged Egypt's
acceptance in the Arab world, thus threatening their national identity. Second, the
Israelis felt that normalization of relations with Egypt would have made them look weak.
According to the author, a reflexive approach to the dispute would have lead to an
exploration of the fundamental values and important experiences of both sides. It would
have helped both sides to look at ancient and modern historical precedents for mistrust.
It would also have lead the two parties away from seeing the dispute as a legal battle
over boundaries and toward an understanding by both sides of underlying psychological
issues and motives. <b></p>

<p>Reflexive Analysis of Causes </b>- When conflicts are defined in terms of mutual
threats and frustrations based upon each side's unique history and experiences, it becomes
possible to identify key issues on both sides. For example, in the Taba dispute one of
Israel' s key needs was to insure national survival, whereas one of Egypt's key needs was
to restore their national pride and sense of importance in the region. A transitional,
reflexive dialog would have made it possible for both countries to gradually move away
from mutual attributions of blame and evil intent and toward mutual understanding based
upon situational attributions for their own and the other's aggressive actions. </p>
<b>

<p>Reflexive Generation of Alternatives -</b> The author says that in order for disputing
parties to begin to doubt the usefulness of adversarial approaches, they need to be able
to consider the other's history, fears, needs, and values in problem-solving strategy
discussions. He says that at this stage more emphasis should be placed on articulating
goals than on generating concrete solutions. <b></p>

<p>Reflexive Implementation</b> - According to the author, at the reflexive implementation
stage the focus should be on identifying as many barriers as possible to successful
implementation of problem-solving strategies. </p>
<b>

<p>Integrative Approach</b> - In this section the author discusses how the integrative
approach could have allowed Israel and Egypt to settle the Taba dispute in ways that were
more constructive and mutually satisfactory. </p>
<b>

<p>Integrative Problem Definition</b> - Israel and Egypt were engaged in five wars with
each other between 1954 and 1979. When, in 1979, they finally sought to change their
relationship to one of peace and cooperation, the relationship was already marked by a
long history of negative attributions for the other's aggressive behavior. Their
adversarial approach to the Taba dispute was therefore quite understandable and
predictable. However, if Egypt and Israel had taken an integrative approach to defining
the problem, they might have framed the Taba dispute as a dysfunctional relationship
between the two countries which hindered a bilateral, creative problem-solving process.
They might have recognized that the real problem lay not with &quot;them&quot; but with
&quot;us.&quot; </p>
<b>

<p>Integrative Analysis of Causes </b>- An integrative analysis of causes could have
revealed the unhealthy nature of the relationship between the two countries. Both Israel
and Egypt felt their needs for security and recognition were being threatened by the
other's insistence upon the importance of keeping the Taba area, and both countries were
projecting their own exaggerated fears onto the other. If the Taba dispute had been framed
in terms of a dysfunctional relationship between Israel and Egypt, it would have been
possible for them to assess more accurately the true causes of the dispute. Only when the
true causes of a dispute are recognized by both sides is it possible for them to work
together to generate creative solutions that will adequately address these underlying
causes. </p>
<b>

<p>Integrative Generation of Alternatives</b> (&quot; Integrative Bargaining&quot; ) -
When disputes like the Taba dispute are framed in adversarial terms, it is typical for the
parties to persistently pursue unilateral solutions. Only when both sides attempt to
understand the other's needs in relations to their own is it possible to generate
alternative proposals that will satisfy the needs of both. Ideally, such proposals can
take the form of cooperative, precedent-setting joint ventures which allow both sides to
win and which offer ongoing opportunities for building a more trustworthy and productive
relationship over time. </p>
<b>

<p>Summary </b>- The author says that possible routes to this type of mutually beneficial
paradigm shift may include: (1) problem-solving workshops, (2) controlled communication,
(3) Track Two diplomacy, and (4) prenegotiation. He also says that the use of third
parties to facilitate joint analyses of conflict tends to yield common definitions of
problems and deeper understandings of the other party's needs and motives. This, in turn,
allows disputing parties to eventually step out of combative roles and into more
cooperative roles. He concludes that although the settlement of the Taba dispute was
positive in that it was achieved without war, it was negative in terms of lost
opportunities for greater mutual understanding, recognition, acceptance, cooperation, and
trust between Israel and Egypt. </p>
