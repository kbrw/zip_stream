<p>The problem with the use of violent confrontation strategies is that they quickly
escalate to the point where the parties' only concerns are victory, vengeance, and
self-defense. In these cases, the moral arguments of people who are being unjustly treated
become irrelevant. What matters is that they have used violent strategies and their
opponent is, therefore, justified in a violent response. This problem is complicated by
the fact that both sides are usually able to argue that the other side started the
violence. </p>

<p>Non-violent resistance strategies, such as those pioneered by&nbsp; Mahatma Gandhi and
Martin Luther King are designed to avoid this trap by absolutely refusing to be drawn into
a violent confrontation. Far from being cowardly, this is a strategy that requires
tremendous courage, self-control, as well as a willingness to endure pain and sometimes
even death. The strength of nonviolence lies in its ability to dramatically reduce the
moral legitimacy of those who persist in using violent strategies against non-violent
opposition. This loss of legitimacy can, in turn, contribute to coalition-building efforts
leading to widespread condemnation of parties using violent strategies and often the
imposition of sanctions by the international community.&nbsp;&nbsp; In essence,
non-violent resistance is a strategy for countering the power of violent force with the
power of the integrative system. Many non-violent techniques ca also be effective when
used against illegitimate uses of legal, political, or other types of force.</p>

<p>Key to the success of&nbsp; non-violent approaches is the willingness of the parties to
base their resistance upon broadly supported moral principles and a communication strategy
which publicizes for all the world to see the immoral and violent behavior of their
opponents. People can't be expected to condemn things that they do not know about. The
success of these publicity efforts requires the presence of impartial and widely trusted
observers, as well as a touch of theater. After all, effective communication strategies
have to successfully compete for the prominent coverage on newspapers, television, and
radio. </p>

<p>There are literally hundreds of different forms of non-violent resistance and struggle,
each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Gene Sharp, one of the leading scholars
on nonviolent direct action has developed a list of 198 forms of nonviolent action, which
he divided into three categories:&nbsp; nonviolent protest and persuasion (the mildest),
noncooperation, and nonviolent intervention (the strongest). Nonviolent protest and
persuasion includes symbolic actions such as marches or parades, picketing, teach-ins, or
vigils--any action which voices peaceful opposition to a policy or a law.&nbsp; The intent
is to persuade others to change their attitude toward that policy and to join the
nonviolent struggle to overturn or correct the policy or law.</p>

<p>Sharp's second category, noncooperation, includes stronger actions which involve
refusal to do things that are normally done to help a person, group, institution, or
government with which one is in conflict.&nbsp; For example, people might refuse to pay
taxes if they disagree with the government's actions spending those taxes; they might
refuse to work, or stage a work slow-down to protest working conditions or business or
government policies; or they might refuse to obey laws they consider to be unfair or
immoral. Noncooperation may be social, political, or economic, depending on what
institution is challenged.</p>

<p>Sharp's strongest category of nonviolent action is intervention, which is designed to
interrupt an ongoing activity or process of the opponent.&nbsp; Examples include
&quot;sit-ins&quot; in which people will sit in a business or government office, stopping
its functioning; or blockages of roads, railroad tracks, or the movement of ships at sea.
&nbsp; Also included in this category are what Sharp called &quot;psychological
interventions,&quot; --for example, self-inflicted fasting.</p>

<p>All of these forms of direct action are effective, Sharp asserts, because they diminish
the legitimacy, and hence the power of the opponent.&nbsp; &quot;Nonviolent action tends
to turn the opponent's violence and repression&nbsp; against his own power position,
weakening it and at the same time strengthening the nonviolent group.&nbsp; Because
violent action and nonviolent action possess quite different mechanisms, and induce
differing forces of change in the society, the opponent's repression. . . can never really
come to grips with the kind of power wielded by the nonviolent actionists.&quot; (The
Politics of Nonviolent Action, Part II.&nbsp; Pp. 111-113). Sharp compares this approach
to the martial art of jiu-jitsu--in which the violent party loses its balance when
confronted with nonviolent opposition.</p>
