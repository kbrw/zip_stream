<p>Power sharing is a strategy for resolving disputes over who should have the most
powerful position in the social hierarchy. Instead of fighting over who should have power
over whom, power sharing relies upon the joint exercise of power. If conflicts can be
reframed to focus on how such power sharing might take place, they can become much more
constructive.</p>

<p>Power sharing can take a variety of forms.&nbsp; One approach is to grant minority
groups autonomy over some--or all--aspects of their own affairs.&nbsp; This autonomy can
be limited to cultural issues:&nbsp; religion and education for example, or it can be
extended to cover the social, economic, and political spheres as well.&nbsp; At the
extreme, it can take the form of granting complete independence and allowing a minority
group to form its own sovereign nation state.</p>

<p>Another approach to power sharing is more integrative.&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance is handled
by leaders from each group who work jointly and cooperatively to make decisions and
resolve conflicts.&nbsp; This approach relies on ethnically neutral decision making and
public policies.&nbsp; Typically the electoral system will be structured to encourage
multi-ethnic coalitions within the political system.</p>

<p>Implementing either approach is usually difficult, as groups holding power are
reluctant to relinquish that power, and groups without it tend to want massive change to
occur more quickly than the dominant group is likely to accept.&nbsp; For this reason,
demands for power-sharing and autonomy often ferment conflict more than they resolve it.
&nbsp; However, if minority groups can frame their demands in a way that emphasizes joint
benefit, and focus on developing a mutually acceptable way of achieving self-determination
for all groups, they are likely to meet with more success than they are if they take a
more combative or competitive approach.</p>

  <dd>This essay examines several failed attempts at peacekeeping and peacemaking.&nbsp; One
    cause of failure is when leaders move toward peace took quickly, before constituents are
    ready.&nbsp; This occurred, for example, in 1957 in Sri Lanka when the Sinhalese Prime
    Minister granted the Tamils limited autonomy, which was quickly overturned as a result of
    a violent backlash.</dd>

    power sharing), he says, is key to effective risk communication.</dd>
