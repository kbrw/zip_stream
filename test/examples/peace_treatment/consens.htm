<p>Consensus building (also called collaborative problem solving or collaboration) is
essentially mediation of a conflict which involves many parties. Usually, the conflict
also involves multiple, complex issues. Examples of consensus building efforts include the
international negotiations over limiting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to protect the ozone
layer, or negotiations about limiting the emission of greenhouse gasses. While consensus
building is probably most often used in environmental disputes, it is applicable to many
other kinds of public policy disputes as well at the community, state, and international
levels.</p>

<p>Consensus building is usually carried out by a mediator or a facilitator.&nbsp; Often a
team of intermediaries is involved. As with a mediator of two-party disputes, the mediator
of a consensus building effort moves through a series of steps. These include 1)
participant identification and recruitment; 2) design of the process to be used (often
involving the participants in this phase); 3) problem definition and analysis; 4)
identification and evaluation of alternative solutions; 5) decision-making; 6)
finalization and approval of the settlement; and 7) implementation.</p>

<p>At the outset the mediator tries to identify all of the parties who should be involved,
and recruits them into the process. If some parties are left out or refuse to participate,
this is likely to cause implementation problems at the end. The mediator also usually
proposes a process and an agenda, but gets the participants involved in a cooperate
enterprise right away as they negotiate&nbsp; the details of the process and agenda. This
gives the participants a sense of control of the process. It also is a relatively easy way
to give the disputants the sense that they can cooperate and effectively work together.
This starts to build trust between the disputants and the mediator, between the disputants
themselves, and with the overall process.</p>

<p>Defining, and often re-defining or &quot;reframing&quot; the conflict is usually the
next step. Facilitators or mediators usually try to get the disputants to reframe the
issues in terms of interests, which are usually negotiable, rather than positions, values,
or needs, which usually are not. </p>

<p>Facilitators then get the parties to brainstorm alternative approaches to the problem.
Sometime this is done as a group; other times it can be done in small work groups, with
different groups of people tackling different issues or different aspects of the overall
problem. An effort is made to develop new, mutually advantageous approaches, rather than
going over the same win-lose approaches that have usually been on the table before.</p>

<p>After the parties generate a list of alternatives, these alternatives are carefully
examined to determine the costs and benefits of each (from each party's point of view),
and the barriers to implementation. Eventually, the choice is narrowed down to one
approach which is fine-tuned, often through a single negotiating text, until all the
parties at the table agree.Thus consensus building differs from majority rule decision
making in that everyone involve must agree with the final decision -- there is no
vote.&nbsp; The negotiators then take the agreement back to their constituencies and try
to get it approved.</p>

<p>This is one of the most difficult steps, as the constituencies have not been involved
in the ongoing process, and often have not developed the level of understanding or trust
necessary to understand why this is the best possible agreement they can get. Negotiators
need to be able to explain exactly why the settlement was drafted as it was, and why it is
to the constituencies' benefit to agree to it. If any one of the groups represented in the
consensus-building process disagrees at this stage, they will likely refuse to sign the
agreement, and the agreement may well fall apart.</p>

<p>If all the parties sign the agreement, the last stage is implementation. This stage is
difficult too, as unforeseen problems inevitably develop. But successful
consensus-building processes are usually able to surmount such problems because the
process improves the opponents' relationship so much that they are able to work together
effectively in the future to overcome implementation problems.</p>
