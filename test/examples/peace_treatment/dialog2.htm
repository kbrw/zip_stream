<p>Conflict managers use the term &quot;dialogue&quot; in a variety of ways. Most dialogue
processes, however, involve people who are engaged in a long-lasting, deep-rooted conflict
sitting down together with a facilitator who will help them explore their feelings about
the conflict and each other, and develop an improved understanding of the concerns, fears,
and needs of the other side. Sometimes the goal of such a process is to develop approaches
to conflict resolution; sometimes the goal is simply improved interpersonal relationships,
understanding, and trust&#150;at least between individuals, if not between the groups as a
whole.</p>

<p>Conflict theorist Jay Rothman describes four different kinds of dialogue. One is
positional or adversarial dialogue. In this situation, disputants meet with a facilitator
to talk, but the conversation continues in the same adversarial (I&#146;m right and you
are wrong) mode that conflicts typically take. In adversarial dialogue disputants engage
in positional bargaining (that is, they focus on firm, usually mutually-incompatible,
positions) and blame each other for the problem.</p>

<p>The second is human relations dialogue. This approach has disputants meeting with a
facilitator to explore their feelings about the conflict and each other. They break down
negative stereotypes, come to know members of the other side as people, and even,
sometimes, as &quot;friends.&quot; They develop a sense of trust and understanding with
the people involved in the process, though they may still disagree on the fundamental
issues in conflict. (For example, they may have a good relationship with a person on the
other side, but still believe that Jerusalem should remain under Jewish-Israeli control,
while other people in the same Middle East dialogue group may believe that Jerusalem
should be under international or Palestinian control.)</p>

<p>Rothman&#146;s third type of dialogue is activist dialogue. This form of dialogue
provides a foundation for action. Disputants from opposite sides of a conflict get
together to rebuild a war-torn city, form a bi-partisan school, or deliver health care to
the sick and injured. The purpose of such dialogue is not just talk and understanding, but
mutual cooperation and assistance. (Mutual understanding and trust are often byproducts,
nevertheless.)</p>

<p>Rothman&#146;s fourth type of dialogue is problem solving dialogue&#150;referred to
elsewhere in these materials as analytical problem solving workshops. Such workshops bring
disputants together to explore their feelings about the conflict and each other (as is
done in human relations dialogue), but special attention is focused on the parties'
fundamental human needs, the absence of which is seen to be a primary cause of most
deep-rooted conflicts. An intense effort is made to jointly reframe the conflict in terms
of needs, and then engage in joint problem solving to develop ways to meet those needs,
and hence resolve the conflict.</p>

<p>Dialogue processes are becoming increasingly widely used. Some (especially human
relations dialogues) are typically facilitated by therapists, religious leaders, and
mediators. Problem solving workshops are typically facilitated by mediators and/or
conflict scholars. As originally conceived, these workshops were to be highly analytical.
Thus conflict scholars with an expertise in conflict theory as well as the particular
conflict at hand were considered the best facilitators. Many problem solving workshops are
still carried out by academicians, but others are facilitated by mediators and other
practitioners with less of a scholarly background.</p>

<p>Other differences between processes are length of time and nature of the participants.
Some processes are just a few hours long, while others last a week or more. Many continue
over a period of time, for example having week-long meetings once or twice a year for
several years. Usually, for these long-lasting meetings, an effort is made to have as much
continuity in participants as possible, although sometimes considerable turn-over in
participation occurs.</p>

<p>The similarities between all of these processes are that they are used to break down
stereotypes, and to build up mutual understanding and trust between members of opposing
groups. They are commonly used in public policy conflicts in the U.S., as well as in
international conflicts and communal or ethnic conflicts around the world. Although they
do not often lead directly to resolution, the mutual understanding that develops can pave
the way for formal negotiations and eventual conflict resolution, even though that is not
their immediate goal.</p>
