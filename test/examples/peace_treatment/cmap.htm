<p>As conflict emerges, it produces considerable confusion. Interactions between the
conflicting parties changes, sometimes radically and abruptly. Levels of unpredictability,
uncertainty and emotion rise. Unwise and costly decisions are made from a lack of
understanding of what is occurring. Since how a conflict emerges largely determines how
costly it will subsequently be, those involved must have the clearest possible
understanding of what is going on.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
Even the simplest interpersonal conflict has many elements. Conflicts involving multiple
parties, large numbers of people, and complex organizations such as governments get to be
enormously complicated. Some conflict theorists (Boulding 1988) present general principles
for analysis. Others (Deutsch 1973) take a very detailed, microanalytical approach to
understanding conflict. Still others (Blalock 1989) do both.&nbsp; Every conflict has
certain basic elements permitting us to produce a roadmap by which a conflict opponent, a
third party intervenor, or simply a student of conflict can find their way through a
particular conflict (Wehr 1979). The primary items in this roadmap include the following:</p>

<p><br WP="BR2">
<strong>Conflict Context</strong>: The mapper first gathers information about the history
of the conflict and its physical and organizational settings. Conflict does not emerge in
a vacuum. Sometimes one conflict is nested within another. The university departmental
conflict referred to below, for example, was greatly influenced by a concurrent
higher-level conflict between the University president and the faculty. </p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<strong>Parties</strong>: Parties in a conflict differ in the directness of their
involvement and the importance of its outcome for them. Primary parties are those who
oppose one another, are using fighting behavior, and have a direct stake in the outcome of
the conflict. Secondary parties have an indirect stake in the outcome. They are often
allies or sympathizers with primary parties but are not direct adversaries. Third parties
are actors such as mediators and peacekeeping forces which might intervene to facilitate
resolution. </p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<strong>Causes and Consequences:</strong> It is not always possible to distinguish a cause
of a conflict from a consequence. In fact, as a conflict emerges, cause and consequence
tend to blend. Hostility might be a consequence of one phase of a conflict and a cause of
the next. Perceived goals and interests incompatibility is perhaps the most basic cause of
social conflict. Identity defense is also common, particularly in the contemporary world
where group awareness and rights have assumed high visibility. Cultural differences and
particularly language are sources of separateness and difference. They create a sense of
self and self-defense which is probably the primary motive for conflict. </p>

<p><br WP="BR2">
<strong>Contrasting beliefs</strong> and values are operating vigorously in much social
conflict. These range from the negative image one has of one's opponent to one's opinion
about a Supreme Being. Disagreement over facts characterizes much conflict and is probably
the most readily resolved. Then there is conflict which occurs out of the need one or both
parties have simply to fight, no matter about what. The conflict is a goal in itself. It
releases tension perhaps. Finally, the explanation for the conflict may be a low capacity
for cooperative conflict resolution within the context. </p>

<p><br WP="BR2">
<strong>Goals and Interests:</strong> There is an important distinction between these two
concepts. Goals are the more or less acknowledged objectives of parties in a conflict.
They usually can put them into words. Sometimes goals are referred to as positions;
specific demands being made by one party or the other. &quot;If you wish to end the
conflict, you must do this or that.&quot; Interests, on the other hand, are what really
motivates the parties, what they really need to achieve: security, recognition, respect,
justice and so on (Burton 1990). An important purpose of mapping is to help opposing
parties to distinguish their goals/positions from their true interests/needs and bring
those goals and interests as close to unity as possible.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<strong>Dynamics:</strong> A conflict is constantly moving and changing. Even if parties
are at stalemate, aspects of the conflict context will be changing. Runaway responses
(Coleman 1956 ) of parties to one another are made more visible through conflict mapping.
Dynamics such as unrestrained escalation and polarization carry participants away from
cooperative resolution toward greater hostility. Perception changes occur within the
opposing sides which reinforce the runaway responses: stereotyping opponents, seeing them
as the negative mirror-image of oneself, imputing to them increasingly malign motives. </p>

<p><br WP="BR2">
<strong>Functions:</strong> The functions of a conflict are its purposes, the positive
consequences it may be having for the opposing parties. These may be simply tension
release or aggressive impulses directed at a more vulnerable party. But a conflict always
has some purposes for those involved. In a particularly intense university departmental
conflict over tenure, minority faculty both inside and outside the department gained new
visibility, solidarity, and alliances with other low-power groups in the university. The
department also became a bit more unified as it defended itself against what it felt was a
unfair accusation. Knowing the consequences of such functions may reveal ways other than
the conflict to produce them and thus move the conflict toward cooperative resolution.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<strong>Regulation Potential:</strong> Every conflict context contains its own
conflict-limiting elements. There may be third parties who could intervene. Internal
limiting factors such as the simple wish of the parties to maintain their relationship can
be used. External limiting factors such as law and higher authority might be introduced.</p>

<p><br WP="BR2">
<strong>Using the conflict map:</strong> A conflict mapper can use this mapping guide in
numerous ways. It can be used by each party on its own, in an effort to clarify the
conflict from their own perspective. Or it can be used jointly, in an effort to understand
both sides' view of the conflict. A third party (such as a mediator) could interview the
conflict parties with the guide, draft a map, ask the parties to modify it from their
perspectives, redraft it, and present it as a first joint step toward cooperative
resolution. Alternatively, this could be done by parties on one side who would solicit
cooperation from their opponents in creating an accurate conflict map. </p>

    track-two problem solving workshops held between citizens of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. in
    an effort to improve the international relationship between those two nations.&nbsp; Part
    of the process described was &quot;mapping the relationship together,&quot; during which
    the parties worked together to create, essentially, a conflict map of their relationship.</dd>
