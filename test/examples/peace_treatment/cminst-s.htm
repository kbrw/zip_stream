<hr>
<font FACE="New York,Times New Roman">

<p>All societies have their own traditional ways of managing and resolving conflicts,
although these can cease to operate effectively in times of severe or protracted conflict.
By re-establishing or empowering the traditional methods, or creating new methods if the
traditional methods really can no longer work, progress toward conflict transformation can
often be made. </p>

<p>One traditional conflict managing institution, for example, is the church. Often
churches can play a conflict-moderating role, helping people to see the common humanity
among disputants, and the need to make peace with &quot;the enemy,&quot; a belief which is
common to many religions. Although some religious leaders believe the church should stay
out of the political arena, if they do get involved in a conflict moderating role, they
can often be quite influential. </p>

<p>The church can also encourage the extended family to engage in conflict management, a
role families have traditionally performed in most societies in the past. The same is true
for communities, through both the social and legal systems.</p>

<p>Sometimes, conflicts change the nature of the society so significantly that new
conflict management or resolution structures must be developed. One example is in the
former Soviet states and other Soviet satellite countries. Once communism was abandoned,
new, democratic political and legal structures needed to be established, which were very
different in structure and procedure than what had gone before. This situation poses a
very difficult problem, as the society must get a working system in place very quickly,
usually without having a plan or the knowledge base necessary to do that. While approaches
can be copied from other places to some degree, every society is different, and things
that work in one place may not work in another. Therefore, dispute resolution systems need
to be designed very carefully, taking into consideration the social needs the system is
supposed to fulfil and the constraints present in the local situation which will determine
how those needs can best be met.</p>

  <dd>Sahnoun explores issues surrounding military and humanitarian interventions in internal
    identity conflicts. Re-establishing traditional conflict management institutions is one
    element of successful preventive diplomacy and peacebuilding, according to Sahnoun.</dd>

  <dt><strong><a HREF="../example/aall7271.htm">Pamela Aall -- Nongovernmental Organizations
    and Peacemaking </a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Aall examines the roles of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in peacemaking. NGOs
    can play a significant role, she says, in restoring civil society and building peace. But
    they must be careful to work in a way that empowers the local people and draws on local
    resources. This can help re-establish traditional, indigenous capacities to regulate and
    resolve conflict, while external intervention that does not empower the local people can
    actually make the conflict worse.</dd>
