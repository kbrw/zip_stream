<p>Finding commonalities or common ground between opponents in intractable conflicts is
extremely important for successful transformation of those conflicts. Often, however, the
emphasis in identity conflicts is on diversity--how the groups are different, and whether
one group or another is superior. Multiracial policies stress the importance of valuing
diversity and honoring the differences between people. However, conflicts cannot be
transformed, and people united in well-functioning societies, unless they are tied
together with some sense of unity and commonality. </p>

<p>Although it often appears that there is no common ground between opposing groups,
usually there is. If nothing else, it is their fear and distrust of the other, which, if
they talk together, may actually link them together since they can relate to the other's
emotions as something they, too, have experienced.</p>

<p>Though most mediators focus on interests and try to find common ground in that area,
commonalities can also occur in values or beliefs, associations (that is, knowing the same
people, being members of the same or similar organizations), roles (having the same job)
or needs. </p>

<p>Although intractable conflicts tend to be characterized by wide and deep-rooted
interest and value differences between the opposing groups, usually the groups can find
some areas of commonality. Often these revolve around needs. All people have similar
fundamental needs: for security, a secure sense of identity, a sense of belonging, and a
sense of efficacy. When conflicts are redefined (or reframed) in terms of such needs, the
commonalities with the other side often become more apparent. For instance, opposing
groups may discover that they both feel that their security is threatened, but if the
security of one side is increased, then they will stop threatening the security of the
other side in an effort to obtain security for themselves. </p>

<p>Fundamental values also are a frequent source of commonality. If nothing else, both
groups usually value human life and family relationships.&nbsp; If they really believe
that a change in their conflict behavior can improve the chances that they and their
children will lead a better life if the conflict is ended, they are likely to try hard to
do that. By coming together and realizing that the people on the other side really are
human--not subhuman animals as enemies are often seen to be--people can quickly find areas
of commonality that lead to better relationships, effective persuasion and interaction,
and conflict transformation.</p>

<p>Bringing opponents together in dialogues or problem solving workshops is often a very
effective way to create a sense of commonality. As people explore their feelings, their
fears, their sense of hurt and hopelessness, they usually can find common ground with
people on the other side who are usually feeling that way too. They then will develop the
incentive to try to remedy those feelings for people on both sides of the conflict.</p>
