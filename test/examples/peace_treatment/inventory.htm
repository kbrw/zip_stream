<p>The first key to dealing effectively with force-based confrontation&nbsp;problems is
for the parties to conduct a systematic inventory of&nbsp; force-based options available
to them and their opponents. The parties need to look at&nbsp; their situation and
honestly ask&nbsp;themselves what options each of the parties have for advancing their
interests--considering all forms of force, not just the most obvious approaches. In
addition to listing the force-based options available, parties should also estimate the
costs and benefits of pursuing each option.&nbsp; This requires an assessment of the
probable reactions of opponents and decision makers, considering both immediate reactions
and likely long-term impacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Options which produce short-term victory may not
be very desirable if they also strengthen the backlash effect in ways which increase the
number future disputes and reduce the party's chances of protecting their interests over
the long term.</p>

<p>Also important is an understanding of the force hierarchy which determines the
relationship between various types of force and which type of force takes precedence in
specific situations. For example, if one party has the ability to win elections, this will
be more powerful than another party's&nbsp;ability to persuade existing decision makers to
adopt particular policies. Or, legal judgments overturning administrative decisions are
take precedence (thus, are more powerful) than those administrative decisions. These more
powerful options often, however, take more time to implement. This means, for example,
that administrative decisions stand, pending legal challenges, just as legislative
decisions stand until the next election</p>

<p>The inventory of force types that follows begins with an <a href="#Illustrative Story">illustrative
story</a> showing how the various force types relate to one another. Next, the <a
href="#Principal Force-based Options">principal force types</a> involved in public policy
disputants are listed in hierarchical order from the most powerful to least
powerful.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally we have included&nbsp; a section outlining a series of <a
href="#General Principles">general principles</a> regarding the use of force.</p>

<h3><a name="Principal Force-based Options">Principal Force-based Options</a></h3>

<p>This public policy force hierarchy is based upon democratic political systems with 1)
large governmental bureaucracies controlled by political appointees, 2) some type of
legislative or parliamentary body which makes laws, 3) some type of judicial process which
resolves disputes concerning the meaning of the laws, and 4) some type of police force to
enforce the laws.&nbsp; Types of force in this category can be used to influence
governmental or public policy decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Different force hierarchies obviously
apply to different types of political systems. The principal types of force found in
democratic political systems include: 

<ol>
  <li><a href="decmkr.htm"><em>Administrative Requests</em></a> --&nbsp; requests to
    government administrators with the authority to make decisions regarding the issue in
    conflict.</li>
  <li><a href="legal_power.htm"><em>Legal action</em></a> based upon established legal
    principles.</li>
  <li><em><a href="legal_power.htm">Legal action</a> </em>undertaken with the goal of setting
    new legal precedents.</li>
  <li><a href="political_power.htm"><em>Lobbying efforts</em> </a>designed to persuade
    democratic law making bodies to change the law. (&quot;Lobbying&quot; is a figure of
    speech referring to attempts to persuade legislators to vote in a particular way.) </li>
  <li><a href="political_power.htm"><em>Electoral campaigns</em></a> designed to elect more
    favorable representatives to law-making bodies or change the laws through popular vote.</li>
  <li><a href="political_power.htm"><em>Public opinion campaigns</em> </a>designed to persuade
    the electorate to support different candidates and policies.</li>
  <li><em>Peaceful efforts to change the <a href="political_power.htm">political system</a></em>
    in ways which are likely to yield more favorable decisions.</li>
  <li><em>Economic actions</em> such as boycott and strikes.</li>
  <li><em>Other <a href="nonviolc.htm">nonviolent direct action</a></em> trying to force
    compliance with one's demands.</li>
  <li><a href="../problem/violence.htm"><em>Violent efforts</em></a> to change the political
    system involving small-scale paramilitary units.</li>
  <li><em>Large-scale military action</em> involving organized military and police forces and,
    perhaps, international intervention..</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="General Principles">General Principles</a> Regarding the Use of Force</h3>

<p>In general, it is usually best to start with the least forceful methods and only move
on to more forceful methods when it becomes clear that less forceful methods will not
succeed.&nbsp; In many cases this means that the parties should actually try each level
before moving to the next higher level. If, however, it is clear that lower levels simply
won't work, then it may be appropriate to move more quickly to the higher levels. In
general, <a href="../!treating_core.htm#lefitfc">legitimacy</a>&nbsp;seems to be enhanced
and the <a href="../!core_problems.htm#forop2-p">backlash effec</a>t reduced when the
parties confine their efforts to the lowest possible levels of force.</p>

<p>Within each level there are more and less legitimate ways in which force can be used.
In general, force is more likely to be seen as legitimate when it is seen as defending
principles of fairness which all parties have an interest in supporting. Legitimacy is
likely to be sharply reduced when force is used for purely selfish purposes, with the
primary goal being to unfairly take something from someone else. </p>

<p>The determination of fairness and legitimacy is not simple, as the section on <a
href="../!treating_core.htm#lefitfc">legitimacy</a>&nbsp; more fully explains. In
addition, definitions of &quot;fairness&quot; vary substantially from one setting to
another. The key question is what principles of fairness are supported by the contending
parties. In some cases, there may be a high degree of agreement on these
&quot;fairness&quot; principles, while there may be only limited agreement in other
situations. Given increasing support for global principles of basic human rights, there
are relatively few situations in which there is absolutely no agreement on these
&quot;fairness&quot; principles. </p>

<p>Force can obviously be used to pursue purely selfish objectives which violate all
reasonable standards of justice. &nbsp;Our attention, however, focuses on ways of using
force to defend, rather than attack, these standards. In other words, our focus is upon
strategies for countering selfish and unjust applications of force.</p>

<h3><a name="Illustrative Story">Illustrative Story</a> Showing the Relationship Between
Force-based Options</h3>

<p>This is a fictitious, but still realistic, story describing the progression through the
various force types which might occur in conjunction with a public policy conflict. &nbsp;
This example focuses upon a conflict which has arisen in the U.S. because citizens living
downstream from a large mine believe that the mine is polluting their drinking water
supply and placing their health in danger. This imaginary case assumes that citizens have
tried to persuade mine owners to install expensive pollution control equipment, and that
the owners have absolutely refused. This example also assumes that the parties' conclusion
that the mine is poisoning their water supply is justified and that residents have
successfully resolved <a href="../!overlay_problems.htm#factfinding">fact-finding
problems.</a>&nbsp; </p>

<p><em>The purpose of this example is to illustrate the relationships that exists between
the different types of force which are available to citizens wishing to force the mine to
operate more safely. Other examples could have been created involving responsible mining
companies and excessive health concerns. Our use of this example is not meant to imply
that all mining companies are selfish and evil or that all citizen groups act fairly. As
soon as possible, we hope to add additional examples that view conflicts from the
perspective of industrial corporations and other types of parties.&nbsp; The following
fictitious example makes the assumption that company officials cannot be persuaded to do
the &quot;right&quot; thing and protect the public health. &nbsp;Often disputes of this
type arise because company officials honestly do not believe that their activities
constitute a significant public health threat. In these cases, it may be best to approach
the situation as a</em>&nbsp; <a href="../!overlay_problems.htm#factfinding">fact-finding
problem</a><em> with the goal of determining the true health risks. </em></p>

<p>In this case, the parties may start with an<em> <strong>administrative request</strong></em>
in which they ask government health or environmental officials to order mine owners to
correct the problem. If the officials agree, the mining agency may comply, they may defy
the order, or they may defend their actions in a lawsuit. (See below.) If the officials
refuse, then the citizen's group might ask higher ranking administrators to overrule the
decision of lower ranking bureaucrats. In democratic societies, this process can can often
be appealed through the bureaucracy until a final decision is made by <em><strong>elected
government officials</strong></em>. &nbsp;&nbsp; If these officials fail correct the
problem, then <em><strong>legal action</strong></em> might be taken on the basis of
established legal principles and the argument that government officials are failing to
fulfill their legal responsibilities and enforce the law.&nbsp;(Alternatively, if
officials try to enforce the law, but the company refuses to comply, they can pursue their
cause in court as well.)&nbsp; If the lower courts fails to require the government and/or
the mine to take corrective action, &nbsp;then their decision can often be appealed to
higher courts.&nbsp; In some cases this made result in the establishment of a new <em><strong>legal
precedent</strong></em>.&nbsp; In other cases the higher courts may find in favor of the
mining company and conclude that existing law prevents the government from taking action
to correct pollution and health problems.&nbsp; </p>

<p>If judicial proceedings fail to force the mining company to clean up their pollution,
the&nbsp; next step available to citizen groups is to attempt to change the
law.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this U.S. this is done by citizen groups trying to persuade legislators
to enact <em><strong>new legislation</strong></em> protecting the public health from water
pollution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp; legislators refuse to make desired changes (in spite
of promises of political support during the next election), the next option would be for
the citizen's group to try to&nbsp;change the makeup of the legislature (or other law
making body) during the next <em><strong>election</strong></em>. This electoral strategy
could also be used against governors, mayors, presidents or other&nbsp; elected officials
who refuse to support pollution control measures. It should be noted, however, that
efforts to force change through election campaigns are only likely to be successful if the
<em><strong>public opinion</strong></em> supports the neighborhood groups in their
struggle with the mining company.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>If public opinion does not support the neighbors, then some type of <em><strong>public
education campaign</strong></em> will be required before mine neighbors can expect to win
an election.&nbsp;&nbsp; In conjunction with this education campaign, citizen groups may
decide the organize <em><strong>public demonstrations</strong></em> and <em><strong>acts
of civil disobedience</strong></em>&nbsp; to draw public attention to their problem. In
addition to influencing government policies, these public demonstrations threaten the
public image of the mining company in the eyes of their customers and stockholders.&nbsp;
This, in turn, can result in strong <em><strong>economic pressure</strong></em> on the
mining company to change its behavior.&nbsp; Such economic pressure can be intensified
through techniques such as <em><strong>boycotts</strong></em> and <em><strong>proxy
battles</strong></em> (in which efforts are made to persuade&nbsp; stockholders to force
the company to change its behavior).&nbsp; Prospects for success may also be increased by <em><strong>coalition
building</strong></em> activities which develop alliances with other citizen groups. </p>

<p>If all of these efforts fail, citizen groups will be placed in an extremely difficult
position.&nbsp; They can decide to <em><strong>accept defeat</strong></em> with the
resulting damage to their health. They can pursue a<em><strong>n empowerment effort</strong></em>
in hope of developing the stronger forcing power that they need to better defend their
interests in the future. They can resort to more revolutionary efforts focused upon
changing the political system in ways which make it make it more responsive to their
needs. This can involve campaigns for relative modest <em><strong>political reforms</strong></em>
(such as term limits for elected officials or limits on campaign contributions). In the
most extreme case, political reform can take the form of <em><strong>revolutionary
movements</strong></em> which attempt to create a completely new government. (This,
obviously, would not occur simply on the basis of a mining pollution conflict, but would
be the result of many different conflicts between citizens and their government over a
long period of time.)</p>
