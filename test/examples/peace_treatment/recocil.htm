<p>Reconciliation is the ultimate goal of peacebuilding. It occurs when disputants develop
a new relationship based on apology, forgiveness, and newly established trust. Mennonite
peacebuilder John Paul Lederach describes reconciliation as &quot;a meeting ground where
trust and mercy have met, and where justice and peace have kissed.&quot; Thus,
reconciliation involves all four processes. It brings people together, enabling them to
grow beyond the past to re-establish a normalized, peaceful, and trusting relationship in
the present. </p>

<p>Obviously, reconciliation is a very difficult and slow process. Lederach points out
that it usually takes just as long to get out of a conflict as it takes to get into one.
So for conflicts that have been going on for decades or centuries, reconciliation cannot
take place in weeks or months--perhaps not even in a few years. It will take many years,
perhaps decades or centuries, to fully recover. Yet progress can be made, and even
incremental steps can have tremendously beneficial effects. </p>

<p>Reconciliation programs can take many forms. Analytical problem solving workshops or
dialogue processes can help build trust and a sense of forgiveness and mercy. If they lead
to wider structural or behavioral changes they can also contribute to the re-establishment
of justice and peace. So can processes such as the South African Truth and Reconciliation
Commissions which have formalized the process of apology and forgiveness. Most efforts at
citizen diplomacy and grassroots peacebuilding--which brings &quot;ordinary&quot; citizens
into a process of trust-building and cooperation with former enemies--contribute to
reconciliation over the long term.</p>
