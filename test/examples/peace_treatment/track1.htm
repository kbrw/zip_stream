<p>The term &quot;diplomacy&quot; refers to the interaction between nation-states.
Traditionally, diplomacy was carried out by government officials--diplomats--who
negotiated treaties, trade policies, and other international agreements. The process of
negotiations ranges from very formal to informal, but it tends to be fairly adversarial
and competitive, relying on distributive or positional bargaining strategies that assume a
win-lose situation. The goal is to maintain power over weaker nations and a balance of
power with nations of equal status. Although conflict resolution theorists have developed
a multi-faceted understanding of power, diplomacy still focuses on the &quot;power
over&quot; approach, believing that power is a zero sum commodity--the more you have, the
less I have. This encourages positional bargaining, rather than a more integrative or
cooperative approach. </p>

<p>Although several efforts have been made to alter the adversarial nature of traditional
diplomacy, none has been very successful. The first was the League of Nations which called
for open diplomacy and collective security. Although the plan was developed by the U.S.
President Woodrow Wilson, the United States failed to support the idea, and the League
quickly failed.</p>

<p>The United Nations was a second attempt at collective security and international
cooperation. The UN has certainly been much more successful than the League of Nations,
but it still has not been able to overcome power rivalries (especially during the Cold
War, but, to some extent, even now) and lacks the money to enable it to completely carry
out its mandate. For this reason, and given the general ineffectiveness of traditional
diplomacy, more and more attention is being given to what has come to be known as
&quot;track two&quot; or &quot;citizen&quot; diplomacy--international negotiations carried
out by private citizens, rather than official diplomats. Most advocates of track two
approaches argue that they are not a replacement for track one, but rather a supplement to
them. Often track two approaches can precede official negotiations, laying the groundwork
and establishing a certain level of trust between people; sometimes they occur
simultaneously.</p>
