<hr>

<p>Mediation is one of several approaches to conflict resolution that uses a &quot;third
party&quot; intermediary to help the disputing parties resolve their conflict. Unlike
arbitration, where the third party actually makes the decision about how the conflict
should be resolved, mediators only assist the parties in their efforts to formulate a
solution of their own. Thus, mediators bring the parties together (or sometimes shuttle
between them), help them describe the problem in terms of negotiable interests and needs
rather than non-negotiable positions, and develop a set of ideas for how the interests and
needs of both sides can be met simultaneously. The mediator will then help the parties
assess the relative merits of the different options and draft an agreement that works best
to satisfy everyone&#146;s interests. It is up to the parties, however, to decide whether
to accept the final agreement or not. While there may be considerable social pressure to
agree to the settlement, if it does not meet the needs of a party as well as an
alternative approach might, that party is still free to reject the settlement and try an
alternative conflict resolution technique, be it litigation, direct action, an election,
or war.</p>

<p>Mediation has been used successfully in many different kinds of conflicts. It is widely
utilized (and very successful) in the United States and elsewhere for handling divorce and
child custody cases. It is also commonly used for other kinds of interpersonal disputes
(such as disputes between neighbors, roommates, or co-workers) labor-management disputes,
community disputes, environmental disputes, and international disputes. </p>

<p>Although it is common in international conflicts, mediation has been less successful in
that context than in most of the others. In a study of 78 international conflicts which
occurred between 1945 and 1986, Jacob Bercovitch (1991) found that 56 were mediated, but
that most of those efforts were unsuccessful. He attributed this lack of success to a
number of factors. One, international conflicts tend to be very complex and highly
escalated, and involving high stakes. This makes negotiation (or by extension, mediation)
very difficult. In addition, mediation tends to work best before conflicts become very
heated. At the same time, however, they have to become heated enough for the parties to
feel a need to resolve them. Thus, there is a very small space of time in which the
conflict is ready or &quot;ripe&quot; for negotiation or mediation. If mediation is tried
either before this time, or afterwards, it is unlikely to succeed.</p>

<p>Other factors that determine the success of international mediation are the nature of
the parties, the issues, and the mediator. The mediator must be highly skilled and
respected. It often also helps if the mediator represents a powerful party who can reward
cooperation and punish obstinance. When he mediated the Camp David Accords, Jimmy Carter
was able to promise U.S. assistance as a reward for cooperation, while he could threaten a
reduction of U.S. support if Egypt or Israel remained resistant to settlement.</p>

<p>Mediation styles vary greatly according to the needs of the parties and the mediator.
In North America, the tendency is for the mediator to be neutral and impartial. That means
he or she is not connected to the disputing parties in any way and does not stand to
benefit by any particular outcome. Therefore, typical mediators supposedly have no bias
toward one party or one solution over another. Other cultures, however, use mediators who
are insiders. They are people who are connected to one side or the other, but who are
highly respected by both sides, nevertheless. They also might have an interest in the
final agreement as they tend to be members of the negotiating communities. Thus, it is in
their personal interest that the conflict be decided in a way that is lasting and fair to
all sides. (Oscar Arias Sanchez&#146;s negotiation of the Esquipulas agreement ending the
Nicaraguan war is an excellent example of &quot;insider-partial&quot; mediation.)</p>

<p>Another difference in style relates to the role of the mediators and the relative
importance placed on settlement as opposed to the importance placed on the relationship.
In the United States, the most common approach to mediation is what is called
&quot;problem solving&quot; or &quot;settlement oriented&quot; mediation. Here the
mediator&#146;s primary goal is obtaining a settlement, and he or she may be highly
directive and manipulative in an effort to bring the parties to a resolution. A less
common approach which is growing in popularity is transformative or relationship-centered
mediation. Here the mediator&#146;s primary goals are empowering both parties to act
effectively on their own behalf, while recognizing the legitimate interests and needs of
the other side. Often, by fostering such empowerment and recognition, the parties are able
to develop a mutually-acceptable solution on their own. However, they are not pushed in
the direction nearly as much as they might be in settlement-oriented mediation.</p>
