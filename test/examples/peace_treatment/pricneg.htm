<p>Principled negotiation is the name given to the interest-based approach to negotiation
set out in the best-known conflict resolution book, <i>Getting to Yes</i>, first published
in 1981 by Roger Fisher and William Ury. The book advocates four fundamental principles of
negotiation: 1) separate the people from the problem; 2) focus on interests, not
positions; 3) invent options for mutual gain; and 4) insist on objective criteria. </p>

<p>Separating the people from the problem means separating relationship issues (or
&quot;people problems&quot;) from substantive issues, and dealing with them independently.
People problems, Fisher, Ury and Patton observe, tend to involve problems of perception,
emotion, and communication. (1991, p. 22) Perceptions are important because they define
the problem and the solution. While there is an &quot;objective reality,&quot; that
reality is interpreted differently by different people in different situations. When
different parties have different understandings of their dispute effective negotiation may
be very difficult to achieve. (This is what we have been calling framing problems.)
Fisher, Ury and Patton suggest seven basic strategies for handling problems of perception.
(Click <a href="../example/fish7421.htm">here</a> for a description of these strategies.)</p>

<p>People problems also often involve difficult emotions &#151; fear, anger, distrust and
anxiety for example. These emotions get intertwined with the substantive issues in the
dispute and make both harder to deal with. Fisher, Ury and Patton suggest five tactics for
disentangling and defusing emotional problems in the negotiation process. (Click here for
a description of these tactics.)</p>

<p>Fisher, Ury and Patton consider communication problems to be &quot;people
problems&quot; as well. They list three types of communication problems. First, disputants
may not be talking to each other. While their comments are formally addressed to the
opponent, they are actually addressing some outside audience. They are grandstanding, or
playing to the crowd. A second communication problem arises when parties are not listening
to each other. Rather than listening attentively to the opponent, parties may instead be
planning their own response, or listening to their own constituency. Finally, even when
parties are both listening and talking to each other, misunderstandings and
misinterpretations may occur. Fisher, Ury and Patton suggest techniques for minimizing
communication problems. (Click here for a description of these techniques.)</p>

<p>Negotiating about interests means negotiating about things that people really want and
need, not what they say that want or need. Often, these are not the same. People tend to
take extreme positions that are designed to counter their opponents&#146; positions. If
asked why they are taking that position, it often turns out that the underlying
reasons--their true interests and needs--are actually compatible, not mutually exclusive. </p>

<p>By focusing on interests, disputing parties can more easily fulfill the third
principle--invent options for mutual gain. This means negotiators should look for new
solutions to the problem that will allow both sides to win, not just fight over the
original positions which assume that for one side to win, the other side must lose.</p>

<p>The fourth rule is to insist on objective criteria for decisions. While not always
available, if some outside, objective criteria for fairness can be found, this can greatly
simplify the negotiation process. If union and management are struggling over a contract,
they can look to see what other similar companies have agreed to use as an outside
objective criteria. If people are negotiating over the price of a car or a house, they can
look at what similar houses or cars have sold for. This gives both sides more guidance as
to what is &quot;fair,&quot; and makes it hard to oppose offers in this range.</p>

<p>Lastly, Fisher, Ury, and Patton counsel negotiators to know what their alternatives
are. If you don&#146;t know what your alternatives to a negotiated agreement are, you
might accept an agreement that is far worse than the one you might have gotten, or reject
one that is far better than you might otherwise achieve. For this reason, Fisher, Ury, and
Patton stress the importance of knowing and improving your BATNA before you conclude
negotiations. (Click here for more information on BATNAs.)</p>

<p>In <i>Getting to Yes</i>, Fisher, Ury, and Patton argue that almost all disputes can be
resolved with principled negotiation. They reject the notion that some conflicts are
inherently win-lose or that positional bargaining is ever a superior approach. Other
theorists, however, disagree--as do we. Principled negotiation is an excellent tool to use
in many disputes, but we have found that it needs to be supplemented with other approaches
in the case of intractable conflicts. It also is more attuned to U.S. and Western European
cultures which emphasize rational cost-benefit analysis, and de-emphasize the importance
of relationships and emotions. Cultures which see relationship issues as central aspects
of the conflict may find principled negotiation less useful. (Click here to read about the

    negotiation.&nbsp; It was a &quot;best-seller&quot; in the U.S. for sometime, and is still

    readable--not long, boring, and scholarly.</dd>

<p>Practically all of the problems discussed in this site can be helped to some extent by
following the rules of principled negotiation.&nbsp; Nevertheless, intractable conflicts
are usually characterized by at least some non-negotiable issues and strong BATNAs, making
its success in reaching complete resolution very unlikely in most cases. &nbsp; A few
