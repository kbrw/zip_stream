<p>Conflict resolution training is often used as either a conflict prevention or a
conflict management technique. It is almost always better to teach people to deal with
their own problems than to come in as an outside third party, act as a one-time mediator
to get the parties through the initial crisis situation, and then leave again, without
doing anything to help them deal with future problems on their own. For that reason, many
intervenors prefer to train or educate people about a variety of conflict resolution
techniques than to mediate a specific conflict.</p>

<p>Training varies greatly in nature and content. Most training is still done on a
face-to-face basis. Sometimes it is done before any serious conflicts break out--hence
being one form of conflict prevention. Other times it is done after a conflict has
developed, but before it is so escalated that mediation is absolutely necessary. At still
other times, it happens in conjunction with mediation. </p>

<p>Some mediators will train the parties before the mediation starts (especially about
communication and negotiations skills and the mediation process itself); others will train
as they go. Even if training is not explicit, one of the benefits of mediation is that the
mediator usually models good communication strategies (such as active listening and
I-messages); integrative, interest-based, or needs-based reframing; and a host of other
techniques which the disputants can use to their benefit in future situations. This is why
many mediators see mediation as being an empowering experience--it teaches the disputants
how to do it themselves next time as well as helping them solve the immediate problem.</p>

<p>Advocates of transformative mediation, however, charge that problem-solving mediation
is not empowering, but rather is disempowering, as the mediator tends to exercise a strong
amount of control over both the process and the outcome, and the disputants don't learn
much, if anything, about how to solve their problems themselves. Transformative mediation
emphasizes the goals of disputant empowerment (for all sides) and mutual recognition as
being more important than the settlement. Hence there is much more emphasis on helping
people learn how to deal with the conflict effectively themselves. However, transformative
mediation assumes that every disputant is capable of making good decisions for him or
herself. Therefore, the mediator will likely refrain from any overt training during the
mediation process. Rather, they will ask questions and restate things in ways which
emphasize opportunities for empowerment and recognition, and gently encourage the parties
to follow those leads if they feel comfortable doing so.</p>

<p>Training can also be transformative in nature, or it can be more problem solving
oriented. Transformative training, in a sense, is similar to what John Paul Lederach
refers to as elicitive training. Rather than coming in as an expert who has all the
answers, Lederach helps people work through a series of exercises to figure out answers
for themselves. Thus, he elicits from them their own knowledge and skills about effective
means for handling conflicts. Elicitive training is especially useful as both a training
tool and an intervention tool. If people learn how to handle their own conflicts, using
their own techniques, these are most likely to be applicable to future conflict situations
they are likely to encounter.</p>
