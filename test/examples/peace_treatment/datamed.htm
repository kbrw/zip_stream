  <dd>In this case study, each of the parties initially collected their own data which led to
    a credibility problem. The problem was resolved by having a third party--the U.S. Army
    Corps of&nbsp; Engineers--do a fact-finding study that was jointly designed by the parties
    and the Corps, and carefully monitored by the parties to make sure it was accurately done.</dd>
