<p>In the United States in the 1960s and 1970s, the public became much more concerned
about and involved in governmental decision making processes than they had been before.
Pressures for increasing the level of public participation in government decision making
at the local, state, and federal levels has led to a wide variety of processes that are
utilized to enable the public to learn about and have input into governmental decisions.
While this has increased the confidence that the public has in its governmental decision
making process, it has also slowed that process down, and at some times, almost brought it
to a halt, as different public interest groups clash over the most desirable option to
pursue.</p>

<p>The most common (but often least effective) form of public participation is the public
hearing. Here a panel of government agency representatives gives a presentation on a
proposed decision, and then the public is asked to stand up and give short (1-3 minute)
speeches indicating their thoughts on the proposed action. Typically, only the people who
are opposed to the decision come to such hearings. Although the government agency can get
a feel for the extent and nature of the opposition, public hearings rarely give a good
indication of overall public opinion, nor do they yield good information about why people
feel the way they do. Thus, they do not contribute effectively to problem solving or
mutual cooperation.</p>

<p>Other forms of public participation may yield more helpful information, but they are
all slower and/or more expensive. Advisory committees made up of citizens can be better
measures of public interests, though they require a level of commitment from the members
that few people are willing and able to provide. Also, citizen members often have
different values than expert committee members. These value differences often lead to
continuous conflicts within the advisory committees, which may detract from the
committee&#146;s effectiveness.</p>

<p>Ballot initiatives are another form of public participation which has greatly increased
in popularity in the United States over the last decade. Ballot initiatives are laws or
constitutional amendments that are proposed and voted upon by the public, not by a
legislative body. While the ability to act as a legislature gives the public much more
power over public decisions, as the number of initiatives increases, more and more people
are voting on things they do not really understand. This leads to the charge that laws are
passed in error, not because the public support for them is actually strong. In addition,
ballot initiatives often oversimplify problems and solutions. For that reason, they often
do not yield effective remedies to problems, despite their popular support.</p>
