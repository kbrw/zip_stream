<p>To better deal with intractable conflicts, we have been developing an approach which we
call<i> constructive confrontation</i>. This approach is based on the assumption that
intense, long-term confrontations over important and difficult issues are inevitable. What
is not inevitable, however, is the destructiveness commonly associated with these
conflicts. (Consider, for example, the deaths in Bosnia and the Middle East,, or the
racial tension resulting from misunderstood and poorly-applied affirmative-action programs
in the United States.) To limit such destructiveness, we suggest that the parties and
intermediaries involved in intractable conflicts should move away from the unrealistic
goal of resolution, and focus, instead, on how these conflicts can be conducted more
constructively.</p>

<p>The constructive confrontation approach follows a medical model in which destructive
conflict processes (but <strong>not</strong> conflicts themselves) are likened to
diseases&#151;pathological processes that adversely affect people, organizations, and
societies as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes these &quot;diseases&quot; can be completely
cured; at other times, we can only limit the most troublesome symptoms. As in medicine,
prevention often works better than a cure.&nbsp; For that reason constructive
confrontation advocates utilizing constructive strategies at the start of a conflict, not
just at the end when the situation is grim.</p>

<p>Also like medicine, constructive confrontation takes an incremental approach. Rather
than looking at conflict as a single problem and asking how can it be completely
&quot;fixed&quot; or resolved, constructive confrontation looks at each aspect of the
conflict process and asks whether or not that part is effective and constructive, and if
not, how it might be improved. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Constructive Confrontation Steps</h3>

<p>As in medicine, the first step in constructive confrontation is diagnosis. This process
begins with preparation of a <i>conflict map</i>. Such a map should include the
identification of active and potential adversary groups and intermediaries, along with
their interests and positions. It should also place the immediate dispute into the context
of the long-term, underlying conflict. </p>

<p>The next part of the diagnosis involves differentiating the core aspects of the
conflict from what we call complicating factors. These are problems in the conflict
process that get &quot;laid over&quot; the core, making the core issues harder to see and
address. Examples include the categories examined in this training program: escalation and
polarization, misunderstandings, fact-finding problems, procedural problems, and framing
problems. </p>

<p>After diagnosing complicating factors, problems in the core confrontation process must
also be identified. These include the inadequate identification of power options, the
inadequate assessment of the costs and benefits of various options, overlooking ripe
moments, and reliance on bitter end power struggles. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Identification, Selection, and Implementation of Treatment Options</h3>

<p>After destructive conflict dynamics are diagnosed, the next step in constructive
confrontation is the identification and implementation of realistic, incremental steps for
reducing as many of the complicating factors as possible. In some cases these remedies
involve easy &quot;don't do its&quot;&#151;pitfalls which are easy to avoid once you see
them.&nbsp; Other steps require either the acquisition of new skills, outside assistance
from conflict professionals, or the making of hard choices for which there are no clear
answers (deciding whether to pursue a short-term victory even though it is likely to
provoke a damaging, long-term backlash, for example.) </p>

<p>While some remedies can be implemented unilaterally, others require the joint efforts
of adversaries, intermediaries, or both. Once specific options are selected and
implemented, results should be monitored and adjustments made when needed as the conflict
continues and changes over time.</p>

<p>The sections of this website list many pathologies and possible treatments, yet this is
still not an exhaustive list of the things that could go wrong. It does, however,
illustrate what one looks for when using the constructive confrontation approach. Once one
starts to look at confrontations in this way, a great many other opportunities for
transforming conflicts in constructive ways appear. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Constructive Confrontation Cycle</h3>

<p>Traditional problem-solving mediation is linear. It goes through a predetermined series
of steps, in a prescribed order. Although different mediators list different steps, most
correspond rather closely to those set out by Chris Moore (1986).&nbsp; First, the parties
are contacted, background information is collected, a strategy is developed, and the
parties' agreement to participate is obtained. Then the mediation session
commences--opening statements are made, issues are defined, interests are elicited,
options for settlement are developed and assessed, and agreement is reached. A settlement
document is drawn up and signed, the mediation is over, and the parties go home. </p>

<p>Constructive confrontation is very different. There is no established beginning point,
and usually no end. Rather, parties begin when and where they want to, usually when they
have decided (or recognized) that the conflict they are involved in is more destructive
than constructive, and that they need to develop a more effective way of managing it. To
do this, they do begin with a diagnosis process (this is necessary), but then they can
choose any of many different approach to treating the pathologies they discover. They can
try to tackle all the problems at once, or they can take them one at a time. They can deal
with misunderstandings first, and then procedural difficulties, or they can go the other
way around. They can start down one path, and switch to another path as the need develops.
Constructive confrontation is very flexible and adaptable to the problem at hand. </p>

<p>Constructive confrontation is also cyclical. After treatments are undertaken, results
are monitored, and strategies adjusted if the treatments did not work. It is expected that
the underlying conflict will continue, so in order to keep that conflict productive,
parties must continue to monitor the changes in core issues and the development of
complicating problems over time. Things that were &quot;fixed&quot; a few months or years
ago may spring up again and need further attention. So constructive confrontation is an
ongoing process, not a one-time event plopped in the middle (or at the end) of a
protracted conflict.</p>

  <dd>This is a short essay which the situation in Northern Ireland in 1989, when the parties
    were just beginning to realize that there would not be a military solution to this
    problem.&nbsp; Broder advocates giving people on all sides of the conflict mediation
    training so that they can change their attitude toward conflicts and learn ways to
    confront the conflict constructively, rather than avoiding it, or confronting it with
    force.</dd>

  <dd>Pearce and Littlejohn present an approach to moral conflict which they call transcendent

    especially that the goal is to find better ways of engaging in and managing moral
    conflicts--not avoiding or resolving them.</dd>

    &nbsp; Although they do not call it constructive confrontation, it shares many elements
