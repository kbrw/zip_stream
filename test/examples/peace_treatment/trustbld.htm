<p>Disputants' distrust of each other is almost always present in intractable conflicts.
Although negotiations can occur, and settlements can be developed before trust is
established, trust-building is very important for complete reconciliation, and it is
certainly helpful in the negotiation process also.</p>

<p>Typically, disputants involved in an intractable conflict are very suspicious of each
other, and may be suspicious of any proposed conflict resolution process as well. One of
the first jobs undertaken by third party intermediaries (or even first-parties who want to
try to resolve the conflict) will be to try to build up a certain level of trust between
the parties and the process. Trust in the process can be developed by explaining the
process very carefully, and allowing the parties to help design it so that it meets their
own needs. If they help in the planning and process design, it reduces the likelihood that
they will feel that the process was designed to work against them. </p>

<p>Trust in the opponent is built up slowly over time, as the parties work together, get
to know each other better, and prove to each other that they are reasonable, predictable,
and worthy of trust. Sometimes trust-building exercises are undertaken before formal
negotiations or mediations begin. Disputants can be brought together to work on a joint
project (independent of any joint problem solving they might do) or they might spend time
together socially, or involved in special trust-building programs. In the United States,
for example, groups are sometimes taken on multi-day outdoor adventure trips, where
participants have to learn to depend on each other to provide food and shelter and find
their way. These moderately stressful experiences can draw people together very quickly
and can build a level of trust between former disputants that far surpasses any that they
had before.</p>

<p>Mediators can help parties establish trust and work together effectively in a number of
other ways during the mediation as well. Allowing all the parties to &quot;tell their
stories&quot;--to explain how they feel and why--can generate a level of understanding and
empathy that begins to break down barriers between people. Mediators can also help
disputants to state their grievances in a nonaccusatory way, and can help them redefine or
&quot;reframe&quot; the conflict in an integrative or &quot;win-win&quot; way, rather than
a &quot;win-lose&quot; way. Although such a reframing is not always possible, when it is,
it makes the opponent much less threatening, and can be very helpful in establishing
greater levels of trust between the parties. </p>

<p>Negotiation expert Roger Fisher warns, however, that trust can be a trap.
&quot;Behaving in a way that makes oneself worthy of trust is highly useful and likely to
be well rewarded. But the more one trusts the other side, the greater the incentive one
provides for behavior that will prove such trust to have been misplaced. . . .Other things
being equal, the less that an agreement depends on trust, the more likely it is to be
implemented.&quot; (Roger Fisher, <u>Beyond Yes</u>, Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard
Program on Negotiation, 1991, p. 124) This means that there should be some external source
of enforcement, or that the agreement should be written so that each side has to do
something before it gets what it wants. </p>

<p>Trust is important, however, for the establishment of normal relationships. The greater
the trust between parties, the more effectively they will be able to live together and
cooperate in the future, which will diminish the chances that the old conflict will
re-occur, or a new unmanageable one will develop.</p>
