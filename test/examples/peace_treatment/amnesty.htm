<p>In many protracted and deep-rooted conflicts, apology and forgiveness are essential for
reconciliation and conflict resolution. As long as one side continues to blame the other
(or both sides blame each other) for their problems, healing cannot occur, and normal
relationships based on mutual acceptance and trust cannot be formed. (Montville 1993, pp.
112).</p>

<p>Apology is often a difficult step, as it requires acknowledging guilt. However, the
lack of apology suggests to the other side that its opponent thinks that its behavior was
appropriate. This creates the fear that the opponent&#146;s unjust or violent behavior
will continue. An apology is a signal, more than anything, that the opponent regrets its
actions and wants to rebuild a new relationship on a stronger foundation.</p>

<p>Forgiveness is also critical for reconciliation. Many people refuse to forgive, feeling
that forgiveness is essentially &quot;giving up&quot; or &quot;letting the enemy get away
with&quot; their actions. Revenge or punishment, they feel, is the only way to achieve
&quot;justice.&quot; Yet the need for revenge or punishment can delay or even prohibit the
resolution of a conflict, as fear of retaliation can keep an opponent from accepting guilt
and apologizing. For this reason, it is often superior to forgive an opponent&#146;s
deeds--even if they were atrocities, to stop further atrocities from happening. </p>

<p>Daniel McFarland argues that forgiveness is not giving up, but is rather an
acknowledgment of the past and a willingness to move on in a new way for the benefit of
both sides. This is superior to revenge, he maintains, because revenge only continues the
conflict and the pain. &quot;The more common misperception is that by performing acts of
revenge, one&#146;s hurt will go away. This notion blocks people from coming out of their
pain and moving on.&quot; McFarland, 1995, p. 10.</p>

<p>Forgiveness becomes institutionalized when amnesty is granted for war crimes or
political crimes against a particular ethnic group (as occurred in South Africa in the
apartheid era, for instance). Some people, both within and outside the victim groups, feel
strongly that such crimes should be prosecuted and the perpetrators punished. This is the
only way to obtain justice, it is argued, which many believe is required before a lasting
peace can be obtained. </p>

<p>Others, however, agree with McFarland, saying that prosecution and punishment will just
prolong the pain, not end it. A better solution, many argue, is recognition of the past,
and amnesty for the perpetrators of violence. The South African Truth and Reconciliation
Commission is one example of this approach. There perpetrators of violence on both sides
of the conflict (white and black) are encouraged to testify about their deeds, after which
they are granted amnesty for their actions. While some South Africans object to the
Reconciliation Commission, it seems evident that the successful transition to black
majority rule could not have occurred as it did without such an amnesty process. </p>
