<p>Most dialogue, negotiation, and consensus processes involve a relatively small number
of people, who may be acting on behalf of a much larger constituency. As the small group
works together over time, they often develop a level of understanding, trust, and an image
of the problem that differs considerably from their constituents, who have not been
involved in the small group process. </p>

<p>Then, when the representatives come back to their constituents with a proposal which
seems reasonable to them (as they understand the constraints under which it was
developed), the constituents may react very differently, because they don't have the
understanding of the process or the substance of the ongoing discussions. (Some scholars
refer to this as the &quot;re-entry problem,&quot;--negotiators or dialogue participants
must &quot;re-enter&quot; their old groups, but when they do so they find they are not
welcome, but rather are shunned, and their work denounced, not applauded.)</p>

<p>One of the causes of this problem is inadequate communication with the constituent
groups as the small group process is going on. Although it is impossible to have everyone
involved in the negotiation or dialogue, if the results of the process are to be
transferred to the larger population, the representatives should frequently check back
with their constituencies to make sure they understand what is happening in the small
group process and, in the case of negotiation, feel as if they have adequate input to it.
Without frequent communication with constituents, the risk of a re-entry problem and the
rejection of any ultimate agreement increases significantly.</p>

  <dd>Although this article stresses the factors that allowed Norway to successfully negotiate
    the Oslo agreements between Israel and the Palestinians, one of the negotiators
    acknowledges that the re-entry problem was a factor that had to be considered in this
    case. This was especially true, since the Oslo negotiations were kept secret while they
    were occurring, and communication with constituencies was highly limited.</dd>
