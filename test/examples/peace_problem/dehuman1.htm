<p>Dehumanization is the process whereby opponents view each other as less than human and
thus not deserving of humane treatment or what are generally accepted as fundamental human
rights. It is necessary, psychologically, to so categorize the enemy if it is to be
possible to engage in warfare or otherwise violate the generally accepted norms of
behavior regarding one's fellow man.</p>

<p>Dehumanization is actually an extension of a less intense process of developing an
&quot;enemy image&quot; of the opponent. An enemy image is a stereotype-a negative
oversimplification--which usually views the opposing group as evil, in contrast to one's
own side, which is seen as entirely good. Enemy images are usually black and white. &nbsp;
Shades of gray (meaning one's own faults or one's enemies' values) are usually discounted,
denied, or ignored. </p>

<p>This is accentuated, according to psychologists, by the process of
&quot;projection&quot;-in which people &quot;project&quot; their own faults onto their
opponents. This means that people or groups who tend to be aggressive or selfish are
likely to attribute those traits to their opponents, but not to themselves. This improves
one's own self-image and group cohesion, but it also escalates the conflict and makes it
easier to dehumanize the other side. </p>

<p>While the formation of enemy images is very common, it is a dangerous process that
becomes especially so when it reaches the level of dehumanization. Once the enemy is
considered to be less than human, it becomes psychologically acceptable to engage in
genocide or other atrocities such as those that occurred in Rwanda, Cambodia, and the
former Yugoslavia. </p>

    Projects of Hope in the Midst of Violence&quot; </a></strong></dt>
  <dd>This is a short summary of one attempt at intervention in Northern Ireland which focused

    Conflict Resolution&quot; </strong></a></dt>
  <dd>This is an academic article which explains how enemy images are formed, how they help to
    perpetuate and intensify conflicts, and how they can be changed. She uses Gorbachev's
    change of attitude toward the United States and Anwar Sadat's change of attitude toward
    Israel as examples of how significant changes in enemy images can come about.</dd>

  <dd>Lederach examines the images that each of the sides had of the other in the prelude to
    the Persian Gulf War and uses that (and other things) to explain why a negotiated
