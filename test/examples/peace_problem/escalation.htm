<p>Escalation is the increase in intensity of a conflict. Perhaps the most destructive
conflict dynamic, the cycle of provocation and counter-provocation eventually results in
the replacement of substantive debate with increasingly hateful and sometimes violent
confrontations directed more at hurting opponents than at advancing interests. This
process plays a crucial role in the long slide toward war and the crossing of taboo lines
which normally restrain our most inhuman impulses. It can also lead people to take ever
more extreme and unjustifiable positions. Escalation alone is sufficiently powerful to
transform what should be a tractable dispute into one that is virtually impossible to
resolve. </p>

<p>Conflict theorists Dean Pruitt and Jeffrey Rubin list five changes that occur as a
conflict escalates. First, parties move from light tactics to heavy tactics. Light tactics
include such things as persuasive arguments, promises, efforts to please the other side,
while heavy tactics include threats, power plays, even violence.&nbsp; Second, the number
of issues in contention grows as parties bring up more and more things that are making
them annoyed or angry. Third, issues move from specific to general, and the relationship
between the parties deteriorates. &quot;What starts out as a small, concrete concern
tends, over the painful history of an escalating exchange, to be supplanted by grandiose
and all-encompassing positions and by a general intolerance of the other party.&quot;
(Pruitt and Rubin, 1986, p. 64.) Fourth, the number of parties grows from one to many, as
more and more people and groups are drawn into the conflict. Fifth, the goal of the
parties changes from &quot;doing well&quot; to winning, and finally, to hurting the other.
</p>

<p>The result of escalation is that a conflict can grow out of control very quickly.
Escalated conflicts cease to be focused on the parties' original problems or goals, nor do
they provide a way for those goals to be realized. Rather, they provide only costs and
continued conflict, with little benefit for anybody. </p>

<p>Yet, escalated conflicts are very hard to reverse. Once relationships have been broken,
once distrust, fear, and hatred grow, and especially, once violence has occurred, it is
very difficult to back away from an escalated conflict and resolve it constructively.
Rather, people tend to continue the fight, if possible, even escalating it further, as
this usually seems less risky than &quot;showing that you are weak&quot; by trying to
initiate de-escalation.</p>

<p>Despite the dangers of escalation, advocates frequently escalate a conflict
intentionally--thinking that they can harness to power of escalation to mobilize support
for their side. While this strategy may appear to work well, it is also likely to build
support for the opposition. Thus the common result is the intensification of the conflict,
not victory. </p>

  <dd>This is a short analysis of the moves made between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. as their
    conflict escalated into what became known as the &quot;Cold War.&quot; Although all of the
    steps are well known, this short story highlights a classic case of escalation, as tactics
    moved from light to heavy, the relationship between the parties continuously deteriorated,
    issues went from specific to general, and more and more parties (i.e., allies) entered the
    conflict.</dd>

    action instead, to avoid such uncontrolled escalation. More information is given in the
