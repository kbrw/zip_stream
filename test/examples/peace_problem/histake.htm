<p>Distributional conflicts are conflicts over who gets what and how much they get. &nbsp;
The item to be distributed is usually tangible--money, land, better houses, better
schools, or better jobs, for example.&nbsp; But the item to be distributed can be
intangible as well.&nbsp; For example, siblings competing for a parent's love could be
considered a distributional conflict. (Although the parents would likely argue that there
is plenty of love to go around, the children may not see it that way.)</p>

<p>Distributional conflicts only become problems when there is not enough to go around.
&nbsp; If there is plenty for everyone, then everyone takes what they need or want, and no
conflict develops.&nbsp; But when there is not enough to satisfy everyone, and no more can
be found or created, the conflict becomes a &quot;win-lose&quot; situation, meaning the
more one party gets (that is, &quot;wins&quot;), the less the other party gets (or the
more he or she &quot;loses.&quot;)&nbsp; When the item to be lost is very important or
valuable, these conflicts tend to become very intractable.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The conflict over Jerusalem, for example, is at least <em>in part</em> a high stakes
distributional conflict.&nbsp; The land--with its historical and religious
significance--is immeasurably valuable.&nbsp; Yet it cannot be expanded, and there is no
way for one group to control it themselves without the other groups who care about the
city &quot;losing.&quot; In theory, the different groups could share control, of course,
but that is very difficult to accomplish in reality, as each of the parties has, as least
so far, viewed shared control as a &quot;loss.&quot;</p>

<p>Conflicts over water in arid lands are also high-stakes classic distributional
conflicts.&nbsp; In the Western U.S., as well as many other arid regions, water is
extremely valuable, as life cannot exist without it, and again, there is not enough to go
around. Here we have endless conflicts over who gets how much water for what purpose.
Although the individual disputes get resolved and a dam will get built or a city will be
allowed to divert water out of a stream for its use, another dispute over the same water
will almost certainly arise again later on.</p>

  <dd>This article sees the Kashmir situation as a classic case of a zero-sum, win-lose high
    stakes distributional conflict.</dd>
