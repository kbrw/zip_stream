<p><font size="3">Conflicts are extremely complicated processes with large numbers of
actors using many different strategies to pursue many different objectives over a long
period of time. The ability of people to deal constructively with these conflicts is
largely determined by how well they understand the situation. If the parties do not
understand who else is involved, what they're doing, and why, it is very easy for them to
adopt strategies that are unlikely to succeed. Unfortunately, the communication and
information gathering needed to provide needed information are expensive and time
consuming. If the parties do not work efficiently they may not have the resources needed
to obtain critically needed information. There is also a problem of resource commitments.
Often the parties decide that they know all they need to know and that their resources
should be devoted to confrontation and not further communication. While there may be times
when this is a defensible position, the parties often break off potentially beneficial
communication.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For example, resource limits often mean that the parties do not have the
time to get to know each other in a personal and in-depth way. Inevitably choices will
have to be made about what information is and is not worth pursuing and when the parties
know enough to act sensibly. For this reason, efficiency is extremely important. It is
easy to waste time gathering more information than needed in some areas and then not
having the information needed for higher priority projects. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">There is also a tendency for people to spend more time than necessary
communicating with friends and supporters (who tell them what they already know) and not
enough time talking to more critical people (opponents, for example) who are willing to
say things that they need to know--even if they are not pleasant to hear. All too often
people pursue communication strategies that only tell them what they want to hear. For
example, people opposing construction of a new factory may spend all of their their time
talking with friends and supporters about the factory's evils and strategies for defeating
the project. They may not talk with proponents of the project to find out what the actual
plans are, or to suggest possible changes that could make the plant's construction a
win-win opportunity for all sides.&nbsp; As a result, the disputants are unlikely to ever
understand one another sufficiently to explore possible compromises.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Problems also result from simple inefficiencies. Important information
can be gathered much more efficiently if people carefully identify the key people to
contact and other sources of valuable information. In some cases library information,
newspaper accounts, and official government documents can be very useful. Important
efficiencies can also be derived from the clever use of information technologies -- fax
machines, audio cassettes, radios, video tapes, e-mail, cell phones, and the Internet.
Ways to use computers to enhance information gathering was the topic of a recent
conference at the U.S. Institute of Peace--<a

<p><font size="3">In cases where published information sources are tightly controlled by
governments committed to the suppression and dissent. a variety of alternative
communication strategies may be useful. In some cases this may involve the creation and
use of a communication system in exile through which supporters in the international
community can exchange information and develop and implement strategies for confronting
injustice. </font></p>

  <dd>This is a description of the aftermath of the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear
    power plant in Pennsylvania (U.S.) Residents' fears about potential risks of cleanup
    activities were high due to lack of information and lack of adequate understanding about
    the plans and the likely effects of those plans.&nbsp; The described Citizen Radiation
    Monitoring Program was a way to address these fears successfully.</dd>
