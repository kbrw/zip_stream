<hr>

<p>Inflammatory statements and personal attacks are two of the most common causes of
conflict escalation. When people attack other people verbally, those attacked are likely
to get especially defensive or angry-much more than they would have had their opponents
kept their statements impersonal and focused on the problem. For example, when people are
told they, personally, are at fault for a particular situation, or that they are evil or
stupid for believing something or advocating a particular action, the person attacked is
likely to respond in a very negative way. They are much more likely to dig in their heels
and stand firm, refusing to listen to the other side's arguments or consider making
compromises or concessions. They will just reject the other side as unreasonable, and
ignore anything they have to say. </p>

<p>When situations are exaggerated or emotional, negative statements are made about the
opponent for the purpose of arousing support for one's own cause, the result is likely to
intensify for both sides. Those making the inflammatory statements will not only increase
support for their own side, they are also likely to increase their opponent's support as
well, as people who realize that the statements are an unfair exaggeration will side with
the party being accused, rather than the accuser. The result will not be a change in the
relative support of one's own group (or in one's power relative to the other side), but
rather an overall escalation of the conflict, which will make it more difficult for both
sides to get what they need.</p>

    Sebok - Lessons from Mediation: An Examination of disputant Behaviors During Mediation and
    Their Possible Application to Seemingly Intractable Conflicts</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>In this paper Sebok reflects on years of mediating interpersonal disputes. He lists a
    variety of things disputants do and say that tend to block agreement, and things that they
    do or say that contributes to an agreement. While he acknowledges that intractable
    conflicts are more challenging that the typical kinds of disputes he deals with in the
    ombuds office, he suggests that similar kinds of problems can make intractable conflicts
    worse, and similar solutions might make them more constructive.</dd>
