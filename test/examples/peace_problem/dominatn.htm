<p>Domination conflicts are conflicts about who is on top (and bottom) of the social,
economic, and/or political hierarchy.&nbsp; Such conflicts may occur between individual
people (for example, between siblings, schoolmates, or co-workers), between groups (for
instance between different racial or ethnic groups), or between nations.&nbsp; These
conflicts tend to be very difficult to resolve because no one wants to be on the bottom,
and few are willing to share the top.&nbsp; Although there are a few societies around the
world that allow everyone (at least adults) equal status, most societies do have some form
of social hierarchy with some people in stronger, more dominant positions, and other
people in weaker, lower positions.&nbsp; Invariably, the people on the bottom want to
reverse the relationship, while the people on the top want to maintain it.&nbsp; Unless
the top people are willing to share their top position with everyone else (thus
eliminating many of the benefits of being on the top), the conflict will most likely
continue.&nbsp; Even if those on the bottom are able to reverse the situation and become
the leadership group, the conflict will continue as the new group on the bottom will begin
their attempt to climb to the top.&nbsp; </p>
