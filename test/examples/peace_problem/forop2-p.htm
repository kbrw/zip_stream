<p>Parties in conflict, especially parties with considerable power, tend to assume that
they can prevail quickly and easily by using threats and/or force.&nbsp; They assume that
the opposing party will simply submit and the problem will be resolved. &nbsp;
Unfortunately, the use of force is seldom this simple.&nbsp; Since people hate to be
forced to do things against their will, the threatened party will usually resist if they
can. If the party that initiates the force does not first consider the likely response of
their opponent, they can easily be faced with defeat instead of victory.</p>

<p>Even if the target group submits to the threat or use of force, they are likely to
become resentful, and will work to build up their power so they can resist or challenge
their opponents at a later time. This is what we refer to as the &quot;backlash
effect&quot;--the tendency of the victim to turn against the threatening party covertly,
or later when their power is stronger.&nbsp; This resentment and resulting backlash is
likely to be especially strong when it is felt that the force is being used in
illegitimate or immoral ways.&nbsp; While the threatened party may do what is required of
them over the short term, they are likely to initiate an intense search for effective
resistance strategies. In some cases they may pretend that they are submitting to the
demands of the threatening party, while in reality they are employing a clever deceptive
strategy which allows them to do most of what they want to do anyway, while simply
appearing to comply with their opponents' demands. . </p>

<p>The backlash effect can also lead the threatened party to pursue a long-term effort to
expand its power base to the point where it can make a credible counterthreats. This can
&nbsp; lead to a protracted judicial, political, or military, or even an all-out, highly
destructive confrontation. Even without such confrontations, backlash can lead to costly
and rapidly escalating arms races, in which both sides devote an ever-greater proportion
of their resources to a desperate effort to make sure that they have the power needed to
defend themselves or at least deter the threatening actions of opponents. In all of these
situations, the result is continuing conflict and not resolution. </p>

  <dd>In a very different context, this article discusses the difference in the ways the
    public and scientific experts assess uncertainty and risk.&nbsp; When people feel that
    they are left out of the risk assessment process they&nbsp; tend to become very rigid in
    their assessments of acceptable risks, whereas when they are involved, they are more
    likely to make the necessary effort to really understand the situation and to make careful
    assessments and decisions. &quot;When coerced,&quot; the authors observe, &quot;people
    become stubborn.&quot; Thus they resist doing what is wanted because force, rather than
    persuasion was used.</dd>
