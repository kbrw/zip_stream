<p>Almost all conflicts involve communication problems, as both a cause and an effect.
Misunderstandings, resulting from poor communication, can easily cause a conflict or make
it worse. Further, once a conflict has started, communication problems often develop
because people in conflict do not communicate with each other as frequently, as openly,
and as accurately as they do when relationships are not strained. Thus communication is
central to most conflict situations. </p>

<p>Communication involves at least two parties--the speaker and the listener. Sometimes
there are third parties: in-between people who carry messages from one person to another,
or the media, for example, which has such transmission of information as its primary goal.
Problems can develop at all three of these sources.</p>

<p>Speakers often are not clear themselves about what they mean, which almost assures that
what they say will be unclear as well. Even when people know what they mean, they often do
not say it as clearly as they should. They may hide their true feelings or ideas
intentionally or unintentionally. Either way, people often get confused about other
people's messages. This is especially common when people from different cultures try to
communicate. Even if their languages are the same, culture acts like a lens through which
we see and interpret the world. If their cultures are different, it is easy for the same
statement to mean one thing to one person and something different to someone else. Thus
intercultural communication is especially prone to errors.</p>

<p>Listeners also are sources of communication problems. People often fail to listen
carefully. They may assume they know what the other person is saying or will say (because
they have heard it before, or they assume that one person is &quot;just like&quot; another
person from the same group). Also, when people are in conflict, they often concentrate
more on what they are going to say in response to their opponent's statement, rather than
listening to their opponents' words with full attention. The result, again, is
misunderstandings, and often unnecessary escalation of a conflict.</p>

<p>Third parties can make communication better, or they can make it worse. Skilled third
parties can help speakers clarify what they are saying, and they can help listeners hear
what is really meant. They can act as go-betweens, carrying messages between people who
cannot or will not meet face-to-face. </p>

<p>Unskilled third parties, or third parties with a different agenda can make matters
worse. The media's goal, for example, is often not helping people understand each other
better, but rather, presenting the story to meet the media's own goals which may be to
inflame the readers' anger in order to sell more newspapers, or to support the publisher's
or government's own interests and views. </p>
