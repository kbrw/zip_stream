<p>In addition to <a href="foropi-p.htm">failing to consider available force-based
approaches</a>, it is also common for the parties to fail to fully consider options for
advancing their interests based upon integrative or exchange-based strategies. For
example, the parties may conclude that there are no benefits to be gained from integrative
strategies which would appeal to a common sense of community&nbsp; or common values
because they do not think there are any such values.&nbsp; Or they may think that their
opponent is so committed to the conflict or their own views that any attempt to change
those views would be a waste of time.&nbsp; Similarly, parties may not consider
negotiation as a way of pursuing opportunities for mutual gain, because they assume that
that they have nothing to trade or that the other side would not be willing to talk.&nbsp;
The result is that the parties often do not even try to overcome the obstacles to the
successful use of these approaches. While such concerns are sometimes legitimate, often
they are not.&nbsp; Exchange strategies and integrative strategies are often valuable to
try in conjunction with force, or as a first alternative to force, because they are likely
to improve the situation incrementally, even if they do not resolve the conflict as a
whole.</p>

<p>In general&nbsp; this problem can be effectively treated by systematically identifying
all possible force-based options (along with exchange-based and integrative approaches).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition it is also important that the relative advantages and
disadvantages of each option&nbsp; be assessed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the parties must be
sure to examine their opponents' options.</p>

<p>Intermediaries would approach this problem from a somewhat different perspective.
Instead of trying to assess their power and the power of their opponents, intermediaries
might focus on helping the parties understand their force-based options and the options of
their opponents. </p>
