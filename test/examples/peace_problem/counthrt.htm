<p>The problem with purely defensive strategies is that the technical characteristics of
many conflict situations may make them unworkable. For example, in spite of the enormous
resources devoted to U.S. President Reagan's Star Wars program, there is still no
realistic prospect for an effective defense against a large scale nuclear missile attack.
Similarly, most army, navy and air force units can be relatively easily converted from a
defensive to an offensive roles. In these and countless similar situations, the parties
cannot depend on defense, and must decide to employ a deterrence or counterthreat strategy
instead--a strategy in which the parties promise to respond to any attack with an attack
of their own which is capable of doing enough damage to offset any benefits which the
threatening party might expect from their initial attack.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, the assumption
is made that no one will attack, because the risks are far higher than the likely
benefits.&nbsp; In the most extreme example, the United States and the Soviet Union both
deterred nuclear attack by promising to respond to any nuclear strike with devastating
counter strike. The assumption was made (and tested several times) that neither country
would actually allow a conflict to escalate far enough to initiate an actual war between
the two superpowers (although proxy wars were fought many times).&nbsp; </p>

<p>The other advantage of a deterrence strategy is that is also gives a party a powerful
offensive capability, should they decide to use it.&nbsp; Given this, however, deterrence
strategies tend to led to an uncontrolled arms race. This can be extremely costly, and can
actually reduce security, rather than increase it.&nbsp; In the United States, we refer to
a saying called &quot;Murphy's Law&quot; which simply states that &quot;if anything can go
wrong, it will.&quot;&nbsp; This law is a popular joke, used to explain misfortune and bad
luck.&nbsp; Conflict theorist Kenneth Boulding added the word
&quot;eventually&quot;--which transformed the joke into a scientific fact -- &quot;if
anything can go wrong, it <em>eventually</em> will.&quot;&nbsp; (This is because anything
that has a finite probability of happening, will, according to mathematical laws,
eventually actually happen.) When applied to deterrence and counterthreats, this law means
that if a deterrent threat is at all credible, it must be possible that it could be used.
&nbsp; And if it is possible, eventually, it will happen.&nbsp; Thus, it is inevitable,
that eventually, something will happen to trigger the confrontation--potentially the
nuclear confrontation--that nobody wanted. For this reason, deterrence is a highly
dangerous and unstable approach to threats which, while it seems to work, actually
presents a greater problem than it provides a solution.</p>
