<p>Parties who are confronted with threats that they don't have the power to resist can
often increase their power by forming coalitions with other parties.&nbsp;By building
coalitions with other groups (or nations),&nbsp; groups (or nations) with similar values
and goals can combine their resources and agree to help each other.&nbsp; This makes each
group much more powerful than they were when they were acting alone.&nbsp; If coalition
building is successful,&nbsp; it may be able to dramatically change the power balance and
help the coalition members successfully resist&nbsp; threats or make effective
counterthreats.&nbsp; (Unfortunately, coalition building can also help parties initiate
threats or pursue illegitimate goals, in which case it is a problem.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coalition building plays a central role in all three types of power (threats, exchange,
and integrative power). This is because groups of people who pool their resources and work
together to advance their common interests are generally more powerful than those who do
not. It is also true that groups of people who fight among themselves are less able to
advance their interests than those who are able to work together. Coalition building is,
therefore, a classic win-win strategy (at least for the members of the coalition) which
can help parties involved in many different situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Coalition building is also a primary mechanism through which disempowered parties can
develop their power base and thereby better defend their interests. For example, a group
being subjected to continuing human rights abuses might be able to considerably enhance
their power to resist by soliciting support from international organizations like Amnesty
International or the United Nations. Also, low power groups are generally much more
successful in defending their interests against the dominant group if they work together,
rather than fighting among themselves in addition to fighting with the dominant group.
