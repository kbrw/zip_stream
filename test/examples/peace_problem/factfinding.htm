<p>Fact finding is an extremely important component of the communication process which
presents its own special set of problems and opportunities to people working to increase
the constructiveness of intractable conflicts. Facts are pieces of information about the
world that can be independently verified by generally accepted research methods as
reliable and a sound bases for decision making and dispute resolution. Facts may involve
technical questions such as:&nbsp; the number of people living in a particular area,
number of acres of land under irrigation, the cost of constructing and supplying a refugee
camp, risks associated with a chemical plant, or the amount of money that a company can
afford to pay its employees and still remain competitive. There are also factual questions
involving the law, such as: What exactly are the procedures for removing an elected
official from office? Who owns a particular piece of land? What are the legal rights that
citizens have when accused of a crime?</p>

<p>In some cases factual questions can be answered with absolute certainty. In other
cases, however, there are large elements of&nbsp; uncertainty. While some of these
uncertainties can be reduced through higher quality fact-finding efforts, there are often
other uncertainties which cannot be eliminated by any reasonable amount of analysis. In
these cases, decisions will have to be made and disputes will have to be resolved on the
basis of incomplete information. </p>

<p>This means that the parties will not know for sure what will happen if they make a
particular decision. For example, estimates of the amount of irrigatable farmland depends
upon rainfall levels and the amount of water in the reservoirs. If weather conditions are
abnormally dry, the amount of farmland will be reduced. If conditions are abnormally wet,
the amount of farmland will increase. Or, land-ownership patterns could vary depending
upon the way in which the courts determine the law. The goal of fact-finding efforts is to
incorporate as much reliable information as possible into the dispute resolution process.
Outlined in this section are problems which make it difficult to achieve this objective.</p>
