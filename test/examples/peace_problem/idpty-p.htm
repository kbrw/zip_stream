<p>Complex public policy conflicts often involve a multitude of people and groups. Some
groups are obvious-the people who are advocating a policy change, and the vocal people or
groups who oppose that change. Usually, however, there are a number of other people or
groups who remain largely hidden, yet are likely to be affected by and therefore concerned
about any decision that is made. If these people are left out of the decision making
process, but are adversely affected by the decision that results, they may become angry
and try to reverse the decision or block its implementation. <br WP="BR1">
