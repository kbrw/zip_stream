<p>Social conflicts always involves some misunderstanding. Conflict parties communicate by
what they say (or do not) and how they behave toward one another. Even normal interaction
involves faulty communication but conflict seems to increase it. The higher the level of
conflict, the more costly misunderstanding may be. During the Cold War, miscommunication
between US and Soviet leaders could be catastrophic in its consequences. At every stage
and level of conflict, clear communication among parties usually works to reduce unwise
decisions by and costs for the participants.</p>

<p>All communication has two parts: a sender and a receiver. The sender has a message he
or she intends to transmit, and she puts it in words which, to her, best reflect what she
is thinking. But many things can intervene to prevent the intended message from being
received. </p>

<p>If the communication is verbal, tone of voice can influence interpretation. The bosses'
words &quot;hey, I noticed you were taking an especially long break this morning,&quot;
could be interpreted as an attack if he said that in a disapproving tone; while the
comment might be seen as a minor reminder about office rules, if it was said in a friendly
way. If the employee had a problem requiring the long break, the comment might have even
been a friendly inquiry about what has happening and whether the employee needed any help.
Here, tone of voice as well as situational and relationship factors would influence the
interpretation of the message. </p>

<p>Nonverbal cues also are important. Is the sender's posture open and friendly, or closed
and cold? Is her facial expression friendly or accusatory? All of these factors influence
how the same words will be received.</p>

<p>In addition to how the message is sent, many additional factors determine how the
message is interpreted by the receiver. All new information we learn is compared with the
knowledge we already have. If it confirms what we already know, we will likely receive the
new information accurately, though we may pay little attention to it. If it disputes our
previous assumptions or interpretation of the situation, we may distort it in our mind so
that it is made to fit our world view, or we may dismiss the information as deceptive,
misguided, or simply wrong.</p>

<p>If the message is ambiguous, the receiver is especially likely to clarify it for
herself in a way which corresponds with her expectations. For example, if two people are
involved in an escalated conflict, and they each assume that the other is going to be
aggressive and hostile, then any ambiguous message will be interpreted as aggressive and
hostile, even if it was not intended to be that way at all. Our expectations work as
blinders or filters that distort what we see so that it fits our preconceived images of
the world. </p>

<p>An analogy can be made to the science experiment done to test people's interpretation
of visual cues. When people were given eye-glasses which turned the world upside down,
they had to suffer through with upside down images for a week or two. But after that,
their brains learned to turn the images back over again, so they were seeing things right
side up. The same thing happens when we hear something we &quot;know&quot; is wrong. Our
brain &quot;fixes&quot; it.</p>

<p>Given our tendency to hear what we expect to hear, it is very easy for people in
conflict to misunderstand each other. Communication is already likely to be strained, and
people will, most likely, want to hide the truth to some extent. Thus the potential for
misperceptions and misunderstandings is high, which can make conflict management or
resolution more difficult.</p>
