<p>When two opposing groups live in the same territory, they may either seek to find a way
to live together, or one or both groups may decide that the only way to resolve the
conflict is to make the other group disappear&#150;figuratively, or perhaps literally, to
push the opponents into the sea. This is the ultimate &quot;zero-sum&quot; or
&quot;win-lose&quot; approach&#150;it assumes that the very existence of the opponent is a
loss for the other side. Thus, the only way one side can win is if they completely
eliminate the other by force. </p>

<p>Needless to say, this way of framing a conflict is a recipe for disaster. There is
almost never a place for the other side to go, nor would they want to go if they could.
Framing the conflict in this way assures a highly destructive and protracted conflict that
will not allow anyone to win. For this reason, it is essential that peacemakers work with
parties to such conflicts to convince them to reframe the problem in terms of finding
strategies for co-existence, not for eliminating the other side.</p>
