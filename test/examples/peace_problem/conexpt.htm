<p><font SIZE="+2">In many cases, an ability to analyze complex technical issues is
essential. Without this ability, the parties are likely to be unable to determine which
options are most likely to advance their interests. Without technical advice, they may
decide to pursue options which hurt them, rather than help them. Thus, effective problem
solving requires an ability to take advantage of the skills of experts.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Unfortunately, experts don't always agree. In fact, experts can usually
be found who are willing to take seemingly opposite positions on any controversial policy
question. The result is what we call the &quot;contradictory expert problem.&quot;
&nbsp; Not surprisingly, the public often concludes that the experts don't know anything
useful and thus that their own uninformed, nontechnical opinions are as good as those of
the experts. The result is often a complete loss of the potential contributions of expert
analysis and the frequent adoption of unworkable options. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">The solution generally involves some type of joint fact-finding process
in which the experts work together to analyze the options and report to all sides their
points of agreement and disagreement, as well as the reasoning behind their conclusions.
While such an approach cannot be expected to resolve all issues, it can provide the
parties with the information that does exist. It can also clearly identify areas of
unavoidable uncertainty.</font></p>

    Industries Negotiate: Mediation and Scientific Issues</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>One aspect of this dispute involved a scientific disagreement over the impact of
    underwater geologic acoustic testing on fish.&nbsp; Initially, the oil companies which
    were doing the testing insisted that their experts found no impact, while the fishermen
    said they did.&nbsp; This was resolved with the formation of a joint fact-finding
    committee.</dd>
