<h1 align="center"><strong>Identifying and Involving all Potential Disputants</strong></h1>

<hr>

<p>Failing to identify and involve all actual or potential disputants in a conflict
resolution process is one reason why such processes fail. Generally, it is desirable to
make sure that all the parties who are likely to be affected by a decision are aware of
the decision making process and are given the opportunity to participate in that process
in some way. </p>

<p>This does not mean that all parties must be directly involved in the
negotiations&#150;it is impossible to have hundreds or thousands or more people sit down
together at a negotiating table. However, all the affected groups must feel that they are
being adequately represented in the negotiating process. This requires that the people at
the negotiating table be accepted by their constituencies as legitimate spokespersons, and
that these representatives keep their constituencies well informed about the progress of
the negotiations, collect dissenting views, and feeding these views back into the
negotiating process in a way that allows them to be dealt with adequately. If this is done
carefully, thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people can feel that they were
actually &quot;involved&quot; in the decision and are likely to support the results of the
decision making process. </p>

<p>If people do not feel they were adequately listened to or represented, however, they
are likely to try to block the negotiations or the implementation of any decision that
comes out of them. This might be done legally by challenging a decision in court, it might
be done by noncooperation&#150;by people simply refusing to do what they are asked to do,
or it might be met by violence, such as that seen in the Middle East in response to the
Oslo accords.</p>

<p>There is an exception, however, to the rule that all potential disputants should be
involved in the negotiating process. If some disputants are so extreme in their views that
they are completely unwilling to compromise, and hence completely unwilling to negotiate
in good faith, then including them in the negotiations may do more harm than good.
Sometimes, they can be included and turned around. Sometimes if they are simply given a
stage to stand on to make their case, they will be satisfied, and then will be willing to
participate in the process in a more constructive way. In other cases, however, they will
try to disrupt the negotiations or take immutable hard-line stances that will prevent any
of the parties from making progress. In such cases, it is usually better to leave these
parties out of the process and instead try to so weaken their public credibility that they
are unable to do much harm, even if they try.</p>
