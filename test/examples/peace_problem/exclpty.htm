<p>Most democratic decision making processes emphasize the importance of interest-group
representation. This representation can come in many different forms, and have varying
degrees of input. When decisions are made by legislative or administrative processes, the
decision makers usually collect the views of their constituents and then try, themselves,
to balance the various interests as much as possible. When decisions are made through an
alternative process-such as negotiation, mediation, or consensus building, the affected
parties themselves craft a solution to their problem. This is where the involvement of all
the affected parties becomes especially critical. If a mediation process is undertaken
with one of the major parties absent, the absent person or group is likely to disagree
with whatever decision is made, and they may try to block its implementation. For this
reason, it is generally considered advisable to get all of the disputants represented at
the negotiating table. </p>

<p>This rule, itself, can create problems however. One problem arises when groups are very
diverse, and who represents whom is unclear. If someone is asked to speak for and
represent a certain group of people, those people may or may not accept that person as
their legitimate spokesman. For example, for many years the Israelis did not accept the
legitimacy of the Palestine Liberation Organization as the representative of the
Palestinian people. The Israelis tried to negotiate with other Palestinian leaders, most
of whom were not considered to be legitimate representatives by the Palestinian people
themselves. As a result, the Palestinians did not really feel they were represented
adequately in these negotiations. (Often the alternate representatives consulted with PLO
leaders to try to ameliorate this problem.)</p>

<p>Another problem or dilemma develops when one or more parties is opposed to the
negotiations, although the majority of people want them to occur. If the person or groups
of people who are opposed to the negotiating process are allowed to take part in the
negotiations, they are likely to be disruptive and to use their seat at the table to try
to defeat any efforts to come to an agreement. If the are left out of the process,
however, they will likely make problems on the outside. This is not an easily solved
dilemma.</p>
