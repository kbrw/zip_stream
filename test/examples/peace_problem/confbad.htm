<hr>

<p>People often believe that conflict is abnormal and bad. They see it disrupting
&quot;normal&quot; relationships and preventing them from attaining their goals. For this
reason, it is often assumed, conflict should be avoided when possible, and when conflict
is inevitable, it should be resolved as quickly as possible. </p>

<p>Although conflict can (and often does) have negative effects, conflict is also
essential for healthy relationships and societies because it allows people to grow and
change, adapting to new situations and inventing new approaches to problems. When conflict
is avoided or suppressed, these positive results cannot take place. </p>

<p>Sociologist Lewis Coser argued that conflict suppression sets the stage for a social
explosion some time in the future, as tension will build up until it finally comes
bursting out. By allowing smaller releases of tension with little, manageable conflicts,
major social catastrophes can be avoided.</p>

  <dd>Folger, Poole, and Stutman describe a theory of conflict which distinguishes between
    realistic, productive conflicts, and nonrealistic, destructive conflicts. Viewing conflict
    as abnormal or bad tends to result in destructive conflict dynamics, they say, while those
    who understand the value of conflict can manage it so that it works to their own
    advantage.</dd>
