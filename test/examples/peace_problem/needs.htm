<p>Abraham Maslow, a psychologist, wrote that all people are driven to fulfill their
fundamental human needs for safety, security, love, a sense of belonging to a group,
self-esteem, and the ability to attain one's goals. A group of conflict theorists--among
them Herbert Kelman and John Burton--have adopted Maslow's ideas to conflict theory,
suggesting that these needs underlie many deep-rooted and intractable conflicts. When
social conflicts are caused by the denial of one or more of these essential needs, the
victims will fight indefinitely for their achievement and will not give up until that goal
is attained. </p>

<p>If this is true, it easily explains why needs conflicts tend to be so intractable.
However, unlike many interest-based conflicts, needs conflicts do not have to be win-lose.
The reasons they seem to be, argues conflict theorist Jay Rothman, is that they are
confused with interest conflicts. Yet unlike land or water or money, which are often in
short supply, needs do not run out. The provision of security to one group does not deny
security to another. Rather, needs tend to be mutually-reinforcing. If one group stops
threatening the other, the first will, most likely, stop threatening them. </p>

<p>Problems develop when conflict becomes so ingrained in the culture that certain people
or groups are unwilling to change their attitudes towards their opponents, or are
unwilling to forgive, even when their opponent's attitudes and behaviors have changed. But
slow reductions in tensions--see the entry on <a href="../treatment/grit.htm">GRIT</a>,
for example--can begin a process which will lead to conflict reduction and eventually,
resolution. However, reconciliation of needs conflicts cannot even begin before the
legitimate needs of all people and groups are recognized and steps started, at least, to
meet them.</p>

  <dd></b>This article tells a story about a conflict over a local celebration that, when
    first planned, overlooked the Native Americans in Alaska, and ended up being a year-long
    celebration of their culture. This is one example of a conflict about identity and
    recognition which was resolved in a very positive way.<b></dd>

  <dd></b>In this article, Sahnoun explores issues surrounding military and humanitarian
    interventions in civil and ethnic conflicts. The common root of these conflicts, he
    observes, is insecurity. This may result in ethnic conflict, religious conflict,
    socio-economic, or justice conflicts. But underneath all of these, he argues, is the sense
    of insecurity. The solution to these conflicts, therefore, is the provision of security to
    the threatened group(s)<b>.</dd>

  <dd></b>This article reviews various situations in which peace-building is necessary,
    focusing on the processes that take place before (pre-) and during (circum-) the official
    negotiations. These arenas are especially important, he argues, because many modern
    conflicts are not amenable to negotiation. Here he is referring to need-based conflicts
    involving issues of identity, justice, security, and dignity. <b></dd>
