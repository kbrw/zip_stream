<p>Trust is an important element in any social system. It links people together, giving
them confidence in each other, in their relationships, and in their agreements. When trust
is lacking, people will not believe what their opponents say; they will doubt their intent
or motivation in any dispute resolution process, and they will fear that any promises
their opponents make will be broken. For this reason, it can be very hard to start--or
finish--a dispute resolution process when the level of distrust between the parties is
high.</p>

<p>Like many other aspects of conflict, distrust tends to grow as conflicts escalate. It
is heightened as communication gets cut off, and misunderstandings begin to occur. Efforts
to persuade using intentional deception can also fuel distrust, as can manipulative or
coercive strategies.</p>

<p>Ironically, however, being too trusting can also be a problem, as leading negotiation
scholar Roger Fisher points out. &quot;The more one trusts the other side, the greater the
incentive one provides for behavior that will prove such trust to have been
misplaced.&quot; (Fisher 1991, p. 124). So trust must be earned and built carefully in any
successful dispute resolution process.</p>
