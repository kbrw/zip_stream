<hr>

<p>In many ways the ability to employ violence on one's behalf represents the ultimate
source of power. Parties who can defeat their opponents in violent confrontations are able
to physically force their enemies to do what they want them to do. If they don't, they
can, if necessary, simply kill them.</p>

<p>In recognition of this fact parties have, throughout history organized large military
forces designed to employ violence on their behalf and to resist the violent assaults of
others. In history and in mythology violent confrontations are seen as central to efforts
to defeat the &quot;evil&quot; enemy. Not surprisingly violence is still widely used in
confrontations ranging from the interpersonal to the international. </p>

<p>There are, however, numerous problems associated with the use of violent dispute
resolution strategies. Most obviously, violence tends to escalate into all-out
confrontations in which the parties employ all of their resources in an attempt to defeat,
and often utterly destroy, their opponents. As violence escalates, taboos against inhumane
treatment are broken, with each atrocity providing justification for future
atrocities.History abounds with horrific stories of the terrible costs of violent
confrontations. </p>

<p>In addition to the death and destruction which accompanies violence, there are also
enormous costs associated with preparing for violent confrontation and making violent
threats. All of the money and effort that is put into a deterrence force is money and
effort that is diverted from more positive uses.&nbsp; Violence also tends to overwhelm
honest efforts to address the core substantive issues, and it destroys the ability of the
parties to engage in mutually beneficial collaborative efforts. </p>

<p>Also disturbing is the fact that violent winners are determined by physical power and
their willingness to use it ruthlessly,&nbsp; not by the moral legitimacy of their goals.
In other words, violent power is commonly used to perpetuate injustice and subjugate less
powerful groups. When parties develop the ability to completely overwhelm their opponents,
then the result can be tyranny. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, when the power balance is firmly in favor of one side, that side is often
tempted to use violence, or at least the threat of violence to accomplish its goals. It is
a well-known technique (unlike less common nonviolent approaches) and it appears to work
fast and effectively, if the long term costs are ignored. </p>

<p>Violence also is the most common response when people are victims of violence from the
other side. It takes enormous courage and training to learn how to effectively counter
violence with nonviolent action. Although this approach can be much more effective than
violence, it is not a route most commonly chosen.</p>

<p>Keys to dealing with the violence problem include:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Programs which help the parties <a href="../!treating_overlays.htm#optionid">recognize
    the costs</a> associated with violent strategies,</p>
    <p>Efforts to bring <a href="../!treating_core.htm#moralhg">moral condemnation</a> to bear
    upon those who use violence in illegitimate ways, </p>
    <p>Establishment of broadly supported <a href="../!treating_core.htm#recog_viol_limits.">political
    and legal institutions</a> which collectively raise police and military forces to jointly
    oppose the illegitimate use of violence.</p>
