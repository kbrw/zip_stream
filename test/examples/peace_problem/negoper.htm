<p>Often people in conflict assume that the other side is completely unreasonable, and is
unwilling to listen to any persuasive argument. The use of force or coercion, it is often
assumed, is the only way to prevail. For this reason, people in some cultures tend to turn
to violent or coercive strategies more quickly and more frequently than they need to. They
do not even consider trying to use more positive strategies--such as persuasion or
negotiation--because they assume that any such effort will be a waste of time or
resources, and may suggest one's own willingness to fight for one's rights is weak. This
outcome is especially likely when one's opponent refuses to listen to persuasive arguments
or accept requests to negotiate. </p>

<p>When conflicts involve groups, not just individuals, different members of each group
will vary in their opinions and in the strength of their opposition to the other side.
Often it is assumed that the entire group believes what the leadership believes. At other
times, the leadership may be fairly moderate, but a few extremists will get coverage by
the media (since extreme stories are sometimes considered more &quot;newsworthy&quot;).
When this happens, people often assume that all members of the opposition are as extreme
as the people described by the media. They therefore conclude that the opposition as a
whole is unreasonable, and that no effort at persuasion stands a chance of succeeding.</p>

    Tragedy for All</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>This is a story about the U.S. government's response to an extremist group which killed
    a number of federal agents. Rather than trying to use persuasion to get the group members
    to surrender, the government relied on threats and force, which resulted in further
    escalation of the conflict and eventually over ninety deaths.</dd>

    Preventive Diplomacy</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>This article examines why preventive diplomacy failed to prevent the Gulf Crisis in
    1991. One reason, Rakisits argues, is that Kuwait steadfastly refused to negotiate with
    Iraq, apparently leaving Iraq with no choice but to drop its demands or to invade. </dd>

    diplomacy to avert Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>In a second article on the Gulf Crisis, Evans points out that Kuwait felt that it could
    not compromise until Iraq withdrew its threat and Iraq felt that it could not withdraw
    until Kuwait agreed to negotiate.</dd>
