<p>Many intractable conflicts are fought over the concept of &quot;justice,&quot; but
defining exactly what that concept means is very difficult. Sometimes &quot;justice&quot;
is defined in terms of equality--everyone should get or have the same amount, regardless
of how hard they work, or &quot;what they put in.&quot; Other people define
&quot;justice&quot; in terms of equity--people should get benefits in proportion to what
they contributed to producing those benefits. In other words, the harder and better you
work, the more you should get as a reward for that work. (The opposite can also be
argued--that people should suffer costs in proportion to the harm they have done others,
which yields the concept of retaliation.) Still other people believe in equity with a
bottom &quot;safety-net&quot; level which protects people who, because of misfortune or
disability, are unable to work or even help themselves. </p>

<p>There is not any rational way to compare these different approaches, other than to
observe that one is more consistent with one culture than another, and that some yield
more benefits, or more harm than an other. (The concept of retaliation, while very
widespread, tends to cause escalation and can yield enormous harm, for example.) But when
people from different cultures come into conflict, as happens so often with minority and
ethnic group conflicts, such differing definitions of justice can be very hard to
reconcile.</p>

<p>Still another definition of justice focuses not on output, but on process. Results can
be &quot;just&quot; if they were obtained by a &quot;just&quot; or fair process. Then the
question becomes, what is a fair process? The answer can be that it yields equal outcomes,
or equitable outcomes, or that it is predictable, or accessible. Other answers might be it
is based on rational cost-benefit analysis, or that it follows traditional procedures. All
of these answers are &quot;right,&quot; in that justice can be defined in that way, and
has often been so. </p>

<p>But problems develop when one party to a conflict defines justice in one way and their
opponent(s) define it differently. This happens very often in domination conflicts, in
which one much more powerful group defines &quot;justice&quot; in terms of the status quo.
(This may be disguised using an equity argument, saying that the more powerful group
contributes more to the society, and hence deserves the greater rewards. Or it may be
disguised in terms of tradition or predictability.) </p>

<p>The subordinate group, however, often defines justice very differently. They will more
likely focus on issues of equality, access to the decision making structure, and/or power.
As is true with other framing problems, when the parties define key ideas, such as
justice, very differently, coming to a joint agreement on how to even approach a problem
can be very difficult.</p>

<p>A different use of the term &quot;justice&quot; is also problematic. This involves the
concept of criminal justice. While each culture has its own criminal justice system, these
sometimes clash with internationally accepted standards of human rights and other
international laws. This yields difficult problems regarding the prosecution of war
crimes, human rights abuses, and acts of genocide. What is &quot;justice&quot; in the case
of the Khmer Rouge, for instance? Is &quot;justice&quot; consistent or compatible with the
concepts of apology and forgiveness which are needed for reconciliation? Or is it opposed
to those concepts? Again, there are no clear answers to these questions. At best there are
processes, through which societies and the world as a whole can move to try to deal with
difficult questions on a case-by-case basis.</p>
