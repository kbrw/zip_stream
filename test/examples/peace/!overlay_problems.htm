    addressed&nbsp; </p>
  </dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="intpos-p"></a><a href="problem/intpos-p.htm">Confusing Interests with
    Positions </a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Often parties are so committed to a single position (what they say they want), that they
    fail to consider why they are holding that position, and whether it really is likely to
    achieve their interests (what they really want).&nbsp; Framing conflicts in terms of
    positions often obscures win-win solutions that become apparent when the conflict is
    framed on the basis of interests. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="intnds-p"></a><a href="problem/intnds-p.htm">Confusing Material
    Interests With Fundamental Human Needs</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Many intractable conflicts involve the inability of one or more groups to meet their
    fundamental human needs--needs for such things as identity, security, dignity, or control.
    Often, however, the importance of these needs is overlooked, and conflicts are defined in
    material terms only. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="incfrm"></a><a href="problem/incfrm.htm">Incompatible Frames</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Often, one party will define a conflict in terms of negotiable interests (that is,
    material things that can be traded, such as wealth or land), while another defines the
    conflict in terms of rights, values, or needs (all of which are intangible things that are
    not usually considered negotiable). While such disagreements do not make resolution
    completely impossible, they do make it harder to obtain.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="compete"></a><a href="problem/compete.htm">Overly Competitive
    Approaches to a Conflict</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>People often approach disputes in a very competitive, win-lose way. They assume that the
    only way they can win is if the other side loses. Consequently, they are very competitive,
    seeking the best possible outcome for themselves, without considering how this will affect
    people on the other side. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="intosea"></a><a href="problem/intosea.htm">&quot;Into-the-Sea&quot;
    Framing</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Sometimes, disputants seem to want their opponent to disappear forever, as if they could
    just be pushed &quot;into the sea.&quot; This kind of framing can lead to genocide or to
    efforts to force opponents into exile. In less extreme situations, this problem may lead a
    party to demand concessions that their opponent cannot possibly accept. When conflicts are
    approached in this way, protracted confrontation becomes inevitable. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="dehuman1"></a><a href="problem/dehuman1.htm">De-Humanization of
    Opponents </a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Violent, catastrophic confrontations seldom occur unless the contending parties have
    de-humanized one another. Once this de-humanization occurs, opponents are seen as having
    no legitimate rights and any atrocities are considered justifiable. The Geneva Conventions
    limit this effect somewhat by setting minimal standards for the treatment of combatants.
    However, history has shown many examples of horrific treatment of combatants and civilians
    both within and outside the context of war. </dd>
  <dt><a name="cemerge" href="problem/cemerge.htm"><strong>Conflict Emergence</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Conflicts are not really identified as problem until the &quot;emerge&quot; from a
    latent state to a manifest state.&nbsp; How this occurs is a major determinant of the
    constructiveness or destructiveness of the conflict as it plays out.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="notmine"></a><a href="problem/notmine.htm">Not My Problem</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Conflicts often arise when one person or group seeks to change the behavior of another,
    but the other does not acknowledge that a problem exists or maintains that it is not their
    responsibility. They are, therefore, likely to refuse to participate in any efforts to
    resolve the issue.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="confbad"></a><a href="problem/confbad.htm">Framing Conflict Itself as
    the Problem</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Often people assume that any conflict is abnormal and bad. However, conflict is a normal
    and unavoidable part of all relationships and societies. It is even essential for the
    healthy functioning of a relationship or social group, because conflict allows people to
    adapt to new situations and invent new approaches to problems. What is bad (though also
    not abnormal) is the destructive ways people commonly deal with conflicts.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="ambgoals"></a><a href="problem/ambgoals.htm">Ambiguous Goals </a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Often people who are confused about what a conflict is really about or what is important
    to them will have ambiguous (that is, confused) goals. This often results in ineffective
    actions which confuse or even enrage the other side, often needlessly. The same thing can
    occur with third parties who enter a conflict to &quot;help.&quot; If they do not have
    clear goals for their for their activities, they can easily do more harm than good. </dd>
  <dt><a name="no-id-op"></a><a href="problem/failidstrat.htm" name="failidop"><strong>Failing
    to Identify Available Options for Dealing with the Situation</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Often people involved in a conflict will assume that there is only one effective way of
    dealing with the situation.&nbsp; If they are used to using force to get their own way,
    they will assume that force is the only available option.&nbsp; If they are lawyers, they
    may assume legal action is the only option.&nbsp; If they are mediators, they may assume
    mediation (or negotiation) is the only available approach, without considering the
    possibility that another approach would be more effective.</dd>

    Identify All of the Other Parties</strong>&nbsp;</a> </font></dt>
  <dd>In complex conflicts involving multiple people and groups, it is easy to overlook some
    people who are likely to be affected by the conflict. If a &quot;solution&quot; is reached
    which ignores these peoples' interests or harms them significantly, these
    &quot;quiet&quot; or hidden groups are likely to emerge and block the agreement.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="idissu-p"></a><a href="problem/idissu-p.htm">Failing to Identify All of
    the Issues in a Conflict </a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Disputants often overlook issues which are important to others, but are not important to
    themselves. People may not realize that there is more than one way to see a situation, or
    that other people or groups may define the problem in a different way.</dd>
  <dt><a name="oppon-op"></a><strong><a href="problem/oppon-op.htm">Failure to Identify
    Opponent's Options</a>1</strong></dt>
  <dd>Parties often fail to identify all of the options that are available to their opponents.
    &nbsp; They may assume that their opponents will simply give in because they have no
    viable options. Or, they may assume that their opponents will fight to the end, unwilling
    to work out a mutually agreeable settlement, when that approach would actually be desired
    by the other side.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="defjust"></a><a href="problem/defjust.htm">Differing Definitions of
    &quot;Justice&quot;</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Often conflicts involve different definitions of justice. What seems &quot;just&quot; or
    &quot;fair&quot; to one group very often seems unjust to an opposing group. Often the
    prevailing definition of justice is set by the group with the most power, while low-power
    groups see their inferior position as unjust.&nbsp; </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="conhist"></a><a href="problem/conhist.htm">Ignoring the Conflict
    History or Current Related Disputes</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Sometimes people think that the dispute they are involved in is new or unique, when it
    is actually part of a conflict or the reappearance of a long-term conflict. Understanding
    the importance of the way the conflict was handled in the past is key to being able to
    confront it effectively in the present.&nbsp; In addition, conflicts do not stand alone,
    but are often related to on-going political, economic, social, or cultural situations.
    Disputants must be aware of the importance of related conflicts if they are to be able to
    confront their own conflict constructively.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="infogat-p"></a><a href="problem/infogat-p.htm">Inadequate Information
    Gathering</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>When conflicts are complex--involving a large number of disputants and/or
    issues--parties must be able to gather a great deal of information before they can plan an
    effective confrontation strategy. Often, time or resource limitations prevent adequate
    information gathering. In other circumstances, information is collected, but it is
    interpreted incorrectly. In either case, the result is likely to inhibit effective action.

  <dt><strong><a name="miscomm"></a><a href="problem/misinter.htm">Misinterpretation of
    Communication</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Even in ordinary circumstances, people often say things that are not interpreted in the
    way the statement was intended. When people are angry with each other, the likelihood of
    misinterpreting communication is greatly increased--to the point where it is almost
    inevitable.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="noundrop"></a><a href="problem/noundrop.htm">Failure to Understand an
    Opponent's Perspective</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>People often view conflicts from very different perspectives depending upon such things
    as cultural background, economic position, and religious beliefs. In order for the parties
    to communicate effectively, they need to understand (though not necessarily agree with)
    the perspectives of other parties to a conflict. </dd>
  <dt><strong><font color="#800000"><em><big>**TOUR**</big></em></font> <a name="cultrbar"></a><a
    href="problem/cultrbar.htm">Cultural Barriers to Effective Communication</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Culture affects both the substance and style of communication. Culture influences how
    people express themselves, to whom they talk, and how. For example, while some people may
    feel comfortable talking openly about their feelings with anyone, others will only talk
    openly and honestly with very close friends, while others may not talk that way at all.
    Such differences can cause people from different cultures to misinterpret both what is
    said and what is left unsaid, leading to misunderstandings.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="langdif"></a><a href="problem/langdif.htm">Language Differences</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>When conflicts involve people who speak different languages (or even different
    dialects), it is very easy for misunderstandings to arise. Even when skilled translators
    are used, it is difficult for translators to transmit complex feelings and emotions as
    clearly as they are originally spoken.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="mmotive"></a><a href="problem/mmotive.htm">Misinterpreted Motives</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Motives can be misinterpreted as easily as statements can be misunderstood. When parties
    are in conflict, there is a tendency to assume the opponent's motives are malign, even
    when they are not.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="stereoty"></a><a href="problem/stereoty.htm">Inaccurate and Overly
    Hostile Stereotypes</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Often, communication difficulties arise because people think they know all they need to
    know about their opponents and that further communication is unnecessary. Yet images of
    opponents tend to be overly hostile and exaggerated. Opponents are seen to be more extreme
    and outrageous than they really are. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="nocomml"></a><a href="problem/nocomml.htm">Lack of Communication
    Channels/Avoided Communication</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Often disputants do not have reliable methods for communicating with opposing parties.
    This may be because they do not want to communicate, or it may be because they are afraid
    to contact their opponents or have no way to do so.&nbsp; Sometimes the parties will
    break-off communication as a form of protest after a particularly disagreeable incident.
    However, the lack of communication can significantly increase the risk of future
    incidents.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="poorlist"></a><a href="problem/poorlist.htm">Poor Listening Skills</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Successful communication requires that the parties listen actively and carefully--asking
    questions and confirming interpretations to make sure they understand what the other
    person is meaning. People seldom work this hard at listening, however. Often in
    conflictual situations, they hardly listen at all&nbsp; Rather, while their opponent is
    talking, they are busy planning their own response. This frequently leads to
    misunderstandings. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="secrecy"></a><a href="problem/secrecy.htm">Secrecy and Deception</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Sometimes information which is critical to the accurate understanding of a situation is
    not available to all parties. This frequently occurs in business conflicts, when companies
    try to keep details about products and processes secret.&nbsp; It also occurs in
    international conflicts when governments keep secrets for &quot;security&quot; reasons.
    This can happen in interpersonal conflicts as well when people simply choose to keep
    particular facts to themselves. </dd>
  <dd>Poor communication also can arise when a party attempts to strengthen its position by
    deliberately providing opponents and other parties with misleading or inaccurate
    information. </dd>
  <dt><a name="inflame"></a><a href="problem/inflame.htm"><strong>Inflammatory Statements</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Sometimes communication can make matters worse rather than better.&nbsp; When
    communication is threatening, hostile, or inflammatory it can do more to escalate a
    conflict than it can to defuse it.&nbsp; </dd>
  <dt><a name="uwpublic"></a><a href="problem/uwpublic.htm"><strong>Inflammatory Media</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Negative and inflammatory publicity is a problem in conflicts--before, during, and after
    negotiations. Before negotiations, the media can intensify a controversy, making it harder
    to get people to work together, or even talk. In the early stages of negotiation, parties
    often advance tentative ideas which could easily backfire if publicized. The resulting
    outcry and complaints could easily undermine an otherwise promising negotiation effort.
    Even after negotiated solutions have been developed, negative publicity can rekindle
    conflicts, making implementation of agreements more difficult.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="badinfo"></a><a href="problem/infogat-p.htm">Inadequate Information
    Gathering/Time Constraints</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Gathering the information needed to sensibly deal with conflict situations is
    time-consuming and expensive. In some cases, misunderstandings will arise because of the
    failure of the parties to invest the time and resources required to obtain important
    information.&nbsp; Sometimes adequate time is simply not available. When direct
    communication is cut off, it is easy to rely on unreliable third party sources--rumor and
    media stories especially. These are notoriously error-prone, and can lead to serious
    misunderstandings.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="crisiscom"></a><a href="problem/crisiscom.htm">Crisis Communication</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>In crisis situations, normal communication channels are likely to be much less
    effective. They often operate too slowly to keep up with the rapid pace of events, or they
    may have been cut off entirely.&nbsp; They may also be unable to resist the increased
    hostility and distrust which crises are likely to create. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="newpatic"></a><a href="problem/newpatic.htm">New, Poorly Informed
    Participants</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>In protracted conflicts, the people involved continually change. Often those playing
    leadership roles give up their positions and other individuals take their place. These new
    leaders frequently have a very limited understanding of the conflict's history and the
    current situation. This lack of information can cause these people to take actions which
    they would not have taken, had they been better informed. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="constcomm"></a><a href="problem/constcom.htm">Constituent Communication
    Problems</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>When dialogue or negotiation occurs among a small group of people, they may develop
    communication skills and a level of interpersonal understanding that is not shared by
    others outside the immediate circle. If these small group processes are intended to have a
    wider effect, it is necessary to transfer the learning that takes place in the small group
    to the larger constituencies which the group represents. Often, however, communication
    between the small group members and their constituents is not adequate to expand the
    learning beyond the immediate circle of participants. </dd>

  <dd>The believability of fact-finding efforts is the sharply reduced when the experts doing
    the fact-finding work are likely to benefit personally by providing misleading
    information. In this case, opponents and the general public are likely to doubt the
    truthfulness or accuracy of the expert's conclusions--even if the expert is acting
    reasonably. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="conexpt"></a><a href="problem/conexpt.htm">Contradictory Experts</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Conflicts often involve different experts making contradictory statements about
    important facts. Because the general public lacks technical expertise, it has no way to
    determine who to believe. As a result, people tend to reject expert analysis and believe
    what they want to believe.&nbsp; When this happens, the potential benefits of objective
    fact finding are likely to be lost. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="factmean"></a><a href="problem/factmean.htm">Understanding the Meaning

  <dt><strong><a name="uncertan"></a><a href="problem/uncertan.htm">Inability to Deal with
    Uncertainty</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Fact-finding efforts are also limited by the skills of the experts. In many cases, the
    best available technical analyses are unable to eliminate key uncertainties,&nbsp; and
    decisions must be made in the absence of firm information. Decision makers are often
    reluctant to act until they have more information, leading to a variety of problems such
    as &quot;analysis paralysis&quot; and delay-default. (see below)</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="aparals"></a><a href="problem/aparals.htm">Analysis
    Paralysis/Delay-Default</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Often the parties attempt to avoid uncertainty by conducting study after study, in an
    effort to resolve an issue once and for all. Where irreducible uncertainties are involved,
    this search for certainty leads to endless delays. This is decision making by default--
    deciding to continue the status quo -- which may not be the best choice, even given the
    uncertainties. </dd>

  <dd>Often democratic decision making processes designed to resolve short-term disputes can

  <dd>Democratic decision making processes can be rushed by parties wishing to avoid

  <dd>Runaway responses are dynamics that support escalation.&nbsp; Paul Wehr discusses
    Coleman's analysis of these processes.</dd>
  <dt><a name="polariz"></a><a href="problem/polariz.htm"><strong>Polarization</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>In an effort to build their power base, parties often seek alliances with other interest
    groups, which agree to help each other as they pursue their separate objectives. In order
    to remain competitive, interest groups tend to form as many alliances as possible. Over
    time, this process tends to divide communities into two large and opposing alliances--a
    process called &quot;polarization.&quot; </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="pattacks"></a><a href="problem/pattacks.htm">Personal Attacks</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Escalation can be intensified when the parties use tactics which personally attack the
    integrity and character of their opponents. This can change the character of a conflict so
    that personal hatred and vindictiveness, rather than the pursuit of just solutions,
    dominate the debate.&nbsp; In making public statements, disputants often try to encourage
    their supporters by trying to find the most clever way of insulting their opponents and
    proclaiming their own virtue. This may bring cheers from supporters, but these unnecessary
    insults can intensify an opponents' hostility and can thereby contribute to the escalation
    spiral.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="violence"></a><a href="problem/violence.htm">Violence</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>The escalation of a conflict to the point of violent confrontation can change a conflict
    so that concern over substantive issues and questions of justice is replaced by fear,
    hatred, and a desire for self-defense and vengeance. These effects are compounded when the
    use of violence is seen as excessive, illegitimate, or unnecessary.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="sacrific"></a><a href="problem/sacrific.htm">Sacrifice Trap</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Often parties involved in serious conflicts are called upon to make enormous sacrifices
    including, in violent conflicts, the loss of human lives. Once such sacrifices have been
    made, it is extremely difficult for leaders to admit that they have made a mistake and the
    sacrifices were unnecessary. This reluctance to admit past errors often leads the parties
    to pursue destructive strategies long after their destructiveness and futility has become
    apparent. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="tactescl"></a><a href="problem/tactescl.htm">Tactical Escalation</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>As conflicts escalate, public interest and willingness to take sides generally
    increases. This can lead to substantial increases in the level of support enjoyed by some
    or all of the parties. Knowing this, disputants often deliberately escalate conflicts in
    order to build support. While this approach can be effective, it usually generates support
    for the other side as well. The result is often an intensification of the conflict with
    little change in the relative power of the parties.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="outgrp"></a><a href="problem/outgrp.htm">Out-Group / Enemy Image</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Often groups define their identity by their common opposition to some enemy or
    &quot;out-group&quot;. While this process can be very effective in strengthening the
    &quot;in-group,&quot; it does so by significantly intensifying the intergroup conflict.
    Nevertheless, this process is often deliberately encouraged by leaders who use it to unify
    their supporters and overcome internal opposition. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="dehumanz"></a><a href="problem/dehuman1.htm">De-Humanization </a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Violent catastrophic confrontations seldom occur unless the contending parties have
    de-humanized one another. Once this de-humanization occurs, opponents are treated as if
    they have no legitimate rights and all manners of atrocities are considered justifiable.
    The Geneva Conventions limit this effect somewhat by setting minimal standards for the
    treatment of combatants. However, recent wars have illustrated that there is no limit to
    what can and has been done to both combatants and civilians.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="extremist"></a><a href="problem/extremist.htm">Extremists</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Most interest groups have supporters who take an extreme view of the conflict. These
    extremists tend to favor more extreme and often violent tactics. They are also likely to
    be very reluctant to accept any form of compromise. In their pursuit of complete victory,
    extremists often take aggressive actions which other members of the group oppose. Problems
    arise when these extremists become viewed as representing the views and tactics of the
    larger group. This tends to lead opponents to conclude that they must respond with extreme
    tactics of their own. The provocative actions of extremists can also threaten broadly
    supported efforts to de-escalate conflicts. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="crises"></a><a href="problem/crises.htm">Crises</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>In crisis situations, disputants are often forced to make important decisions very
    quickly with information which is usually incomplete and unreliable. Given such
    uncertainty, decision makers often feel that they must take a cautious, worst-case
    approach and assume that their opponents are acting in the most threatening way possible.
    This often leads the parties to take more forceful actions than necessary, which
    dramatically intensifies the conflict. For example, in cases where military forces are on
    a hair-trigger alert, parties are under intense pressure to respond instantly and
    forcefully for fear that the other party's quick action will allow them to seize the
    advantage.&nbsp; </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="emotion"></a><a href="problem/emotion.htm">Emotions</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>The escalation process is commonly accompanied by very strong emotions which make it
    difficult for the parties to calmly assess the situation and determine how best to advance
    their interests. Since emotions lie at the core of many difficult conflicts, they must be
    addressed and cannot be simply suppressed.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="stalemat"></a><a href="problem/stalemat.htm">Stalemate</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Escalation can intensify conflicts to the point where the parties will use all available
    resources to protect their interests. Often, this leads to a standoff in which neither
    party has the power to win, and neither party is willing to back down or admit defeat.
    This can be extremely destructive to all sides, as they continue to pour resources and
    lives into the struggle, with little or no hope of victory. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="infmedia"></a><a href="problem/uwpublic.htm">Inflammatory Media </a></strong></dt>
  <dd>The media (newspapers, radio, and television) in many countries make more money when
    they have a larger audience. Audiences can be expanded, it is commonly believed, by
    stressing extreme news and ideas, rather than common occurrences. For this reason, the
    media tends to report on the most outrageous occurrences and the most extreme statements,
    rather than conciliatory gestures or efforts to compromise or solve problems. This happens
    with governmentally controlled media as well, if the government wants to use the media to
    influence public opinion against another group.&nbsp; Thus the media often contributes
    greatly to the escalation of conflicts. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="procrst"></a><a href="problem/procrst.htm">Procrastination of Response </a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Often disputants or third parties realize a conflict is getting out of hand, but they
    delay corrective efforts until the situation is really unmanageable. </dd>
