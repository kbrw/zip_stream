  <dt><a name="foropi-p"></a><a href="problem/foropi-p.htm"><strong>Failure to Recognize
    Available Force-Based Options </strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Disputants often fail to recognize that they usually have a large number of force-based
    options, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. This lack of awareness of
    available options can cause people to pursue ineffective confrontation strategies.&nbsp;
    For example, people may pursue violent resistance strategies, when&nbsp; non-violent
    action might be more effective. Or, people might pursue hopeless election campaigns when
    legal action would be more likely to protect their rights. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="forconly"></a><a href="problem/forconly.htm">Assuming Force is the Only
    Source of Power</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Faced with a difficult conflict, disputants sometimes overlook the possibility of using
    negotiation or persuasion to improve the situation, relying instead on force. This is
    especially likely to occur when force has already been used by the other side. In this
    case, the most common reaction is to respond with equal or even greater force. However,
    this type of response is likely to escalate the conflict, while other options might
    protect one's interests just as well or better, without making matters worse.&nbsp; </dd>
  <dt><a name="viol_limits"></a><strong><a href="problem/viol_limits.htm">Absence of Violence
    Limiting Mechanisms</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Force based options differ dramatically depending upon whether or not force is being
    used in a situation where effective violence limiting mechanisms are in place.
    &nbsp;Failure to understand these differences can lead to the selection of inappropriate
    and ineffective strategies. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="forop2-p"></a><a href="problem/forop2-p.htm">Failure to Anticipate
    Opponent Reactions and the Backlash Effect</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>People or groups who use forced-based strategies often assume that their opponents will
    quickly submit to their demands, thereby providing a quick route to victory.&nbsp;
    However, most people hate to be forced to do things against their will, so they can be
    expected to use any means available to resist the use of force.&nbsp; This can make it
    difficult to predict how opponents will respond to one's force-based initiatives. Even if
    they appear to submit, they often will try to build up their power so that they can
    retaliate or reverse the decision at a later time.&nbsp; (This is what we call the
    &quot;backlash effect.&quot;) </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="threat"></a><a href="problem/threat.htm">Misunderstanding the
    Relationship Between Threat and Force</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>While threatening to use force is quite inexpensive, carrying out the threats and
    actually using force can be costly and dangerous. Often, parties who fail to understand
    this use threat-based strategies too frequently and in ways which limit their ability to
    advance their interests. </dd>
  <dt><a name="backlash"></a><a href="problem/illegit_force.htm" name="illeg_force"><strong>Illegitimate
    or Excessive Use of Force</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Resentment and retaliation is especially likely when victims of force believe that the
    use of force was illegitimate. In this situation, the losing party is likely to try to
    build up their own forcing power in hopes of challenging the victor at the earliest
    possible opportunity. The result is likely to be a long-term intensification of the
    conflict, rather than resolution.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="bitternd"></a><a href="problem/bitternd.htm">Pursuing Force to the
    Bitter End</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Disputants often incorrectly assume that there is no alternative to pursuing force-based
    strategies to the point of ultimate victory or defeat--in spite of the enormous costs
    involved. </dd>

  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="submit"></a><a href="problem/submission.htm">Submission</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>In cases where people are subjected to overwhelming force which they do not have the
    power to resist, it may be most appropriate to simply accept defeat and try (at least over
    the short term) to make the best of a bad situation.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="subvert"></a><a href="problem/subversion.htm">Subversion</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Often, people who are being subjected to force pretend that they are submitting to the
    demands of the forcing or threatening party, when in reality they are pursuing a deceptive
    strategy which allows them to avoid complying with those demands.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="defy"></a><a href="problem/defy.htm">Defiance</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>The cost of using force-based threats increases dramatically when the opponent responds
    to a threat with defiance rather than submission. This forces the threatening party to
    carry out the threat or admit that it was only a bluff. Carrying out a threat is likely to
    result in an expensive, destructive, and rapidly escalating confrontation, while
    withdrawing the threat is likely to undermine a party's ability to use threat and
    force-based strategies in the future. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="Defense"></a><a href="problem/defense.htm">Defense</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Defense is a strategy which allows people to prevent others from successfully using
    force against them. Successful defense strategies do not, however, give the defending
    party the ability to successfully use force against their opponents<font color="#800000">.
    </font></dd>
  <dt><a name="Coalition"></a><a href="problem/coalition.htm"><strong>Coalition Building</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>People can build their power base and their ability to pursue (or resist) force-based
    strategies by building coalitions with people with complementary interests. Members of
    these coalitions promise to help each other advance their interests and defend themselves
    from force-based strategies of their opponents.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="counthrt"></a><a href="problem/counthrt.htm">Deterrence,
    Counter-Threats (and Arms Races)</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Often disputants respond to force-based threats with counter-threats rather than
    submission. Such threats and counter-threats can result in rapid escalation of a conflict.
    In military situations, this is called an &quot;arms race.&quot; Similar dynamics can
    arise with legal, political, or other types of force as well. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="flight"></a><a href="problem/flight.htm">Flight (Refugees)</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Another possible response to overwhelming force is flight, in which the parties simply
    flee the area. It is this strategy which is responsible for the large numbers of refugees
    who flee the world's trouble spots. </dd>

  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="worstop"></a><a href="problem/worstop.htm">Assuming Monolithic, Worst
    Case Opponents</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Disputants often take the worst possible view of their opponents' intentions and
    strategies.&nbsp; Usually, such worst-case scenarios are inaccurate. &nbsp; Using them as
    a basis for making strategic decisions is usually unwise, as it is likely to antagonize
    moderate members of the opposing group and lead to unnecessary escalation.</dd>
  <dt><font color="#008000"><strong><a name="costfrc"></a><a href="problem/costfrc.htm">Neglecting
    Costs and Risks of Using Force</a></strong></font></dt>
  <dd>Parties often decide to pursue force-based strategies based on optimistic assumptions
    about the likely costs and probability of success. Leaders often encourage their
    supporters to make optimistic assumptions as a way of building support for a particular
    strategy. However, this process may lead the disputants to greatly underestimate the costs
    and risks of force, resulting in a poor choice of confrontation strategies. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="human_rights"></a><a href="problem/human_rights.htm">Human Rights/War
    Crime Problem</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>In extremely polarized and escalated conflicts one group may violate another's
    fundamental human rights (through murder, torture, or kidnapping, for example). &nbsp;
    Although forbidden by international law, such human rights abuses are, unfortunately,
    rather common, and are very difficult to deal with without considerable outside
    intervention. </dd>
  <dt><a name="no_mil"></a><a href="problem/no_mil.htm"><strong>Lack of Viable Military
    Options</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>In situations in which effective violence-limiting mechanisms are absent, disputants
    often conclude that military options provide the best mechanism for protecting their
    interests.&nbsp; This is not always true, however, as military victory is often difficult
    to obtain.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="tyrannx"></a><a href="problem/tyrannx.htm">Tyranny of the
    Powerful/Disempowerment</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>While there are many effective strategies for helping the disempowered better defend
    their interests and resist injustice, these strategies will not work in all situations.
    There are times when the more powerful parties are&nbsp; going to win (at least over the
    short term), even though their cause is not legitimate. </dd>
  <strong>
  <dt><a name="ostracize"></a><a href="problem/ostracize.htm">Ostracizing Losers</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Often, the losing parties are ostracized by the society to which they belong. In
    addition to failing to achieve their objectives, they also often find themselves treated
    as second-class citizens who are the subject of scorn and discrimination. This can lead to
    continuing hostility and further conflict.<em>&nbsp; </em></dd>

  <dt><strong><a name="selfish"></a><a href="problem/selfish.htm">Ineffective Persuasion</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Often the parties' attempts at &quot;persuasion&quot; are little more than

  <dd>Efforts to persuade people to do &quot;the right thing&quot; are complicated by
    differing value systems. Religious and cultural groups have different and often
    contradictory images of what is right and wrong, or good and evil--which can make it very
    difficult to agree on what is the &quot;right thing&quot; to do. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="nolegit"></a><a href="problem/nolegit.htm">Lack of Legitimacy</a></strong></dt>

  <dd>While not essential to conflict resolution, when parties to a conflict trust each other,
    their ability to resolve the conflict successfully is greatly increased. The opposite is
    also true, however. When parties distrust each other--as they often do after a protracted
    conflict--it can be very hard to come to any agreements, because both sides will fear that
    the other side cannot be relied upon to keep its promises. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="prejdisc"></a><a href="problem/prejdisc.htm">Prejudice / Discrimination</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Prejudice and discrimination are very common problems in societies with different
    racial, ethnic, or national groups. Such problems undermine the sense of commonality and
    community among the citizens, making conflict more likely and constructive confrontation
    more difficult.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="nocminst"></a><a href="problem/nocminst.htm">Erosion of Traditional
    Conflict Management Institutions (Extended families, churches, or judicial systems for

  <dd>Most societies have existing institutions or social structures which are used (and
    accepted) as legitimate means of resolving conflicts. When these structures or processes
    are damaged, the ability of the society to manage its conflicts successfully is reduced. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="noisys"></a><a href="problem/noisys.htm">Integrative System Does Not

  <dd>All societies and groups are held together, at least to some extent, by social bonds.
    When these bonds are strong, the people involved in the society (or group or family unit)
    identify as part of that unit and feel allegiance to it. Severe conflict, however, can
    break down these bonds to the point that all sense of community or belonging is lost. In
    this case the ability to use integrative power to alter the course of the conflict is very
    limited. </dd>

  <dt><a name="batna"></a><a href="problem/batna.htm"><strong>Limits to Agreement: Better
    Alternatives</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Opportunities for a resolving a dispute by voluntary agreement are limited by the
    parties' alternatives to that agreement. This is because disputants will usually not
    accept any agreement that is worse for them than the outcome which they think they can
    obtain in another way. For example, if a negotiated agreement requires compromises that
    they think they can avoid with a show of force, force will likely be used instead of
    negotiation.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, parties have unreasonable expectations of what they
    stand to achieve from negotiation or the continuation of the conflict. If they think they
    can win more by continuing the conflict than is possible in any circumstance, they may
    continue to pursue the conflict, even when it will actually do them more harm than good. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="timing-p"></a><a href="problem/timing-p.htm">Poor Timing</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Parties sometimes attempt to negotiate an agreement when one or more key parties is not
    ready. Usually this is because one or more disputants believe that they have some other
    (usually force-based) option which will yield a better outcome than anything they could
    get from negotiation. While this disputant may come to negotiations (just in case they are
    wrong), they will probably not pursue the negotiations in earnest, and will still rely on
    their alternative force-based strategy to get what they want. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="missripe"></a><a href="problem/missripe.htm">Overlooking Ripe Moments
    for Negotiation</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>The opposite problem occurs when disputants do not recognize that a conflict is

    successful. </dd>
  <dt><a name="refuseneg"></a><a href="problem/nonegat1.htm"><strong>Refusal to Negotiate</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Another important obstacle to successful negotiation is the common refusal of the
    parties to come to the negotiating table. In some cases this refusal to negotiate results
    from the parties' fear that they will be forced to accept unwanted compromises. In other
    cases the parties believe that negotiations are a waste of time since they will require
    substantial resource commitments and are doomed to failure. Parties to a protracted,
    escalated conflict may be so angry with each other that they will not pursue or accept a
    mutually beneficial agreement, because they do not want to do anything that will help
    their opponent.</dd>

  <dt><strong><a name="wrongpty"></a><a href="problem/wrongpty.htm">Wrong (or Missing) Parties
    at the Table</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>If negotiation or mediation is undertaken with the wrong parties at the negotiating
    table, the results will not be successful. Typical problems are that the people at the
    table do not really represent the constituencies or groups that they are supposed to
    represent, or they do not have decision-making authority, or even links to it. Another
    problem is that critical parties are missing from the table--either because they were not
    invited, or because they chose not to come. Either way, this is likely to cause problems
    later on when a decision is reached which does not represent the interests of all the

  <dt><strong><a name="allornoth"></a><a href="problem/allornoth.htm">All or Nothing Approach</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Sometimes disputants will refuse to consider any type of mutually beneficial agreement
    or relationship until the core intractable issues have been resolved. Usually, they hope
    that withholding normal relations will pressure an opponent into making concessions. While
    this strategy may be effective at times, it also blocks the relationship-building
    activities which can provide a basis for constructively addressing the core issues. A
    similar problem is that disputants may be unwilling to pursue a short-term agreement and
    partial victory, because they fear that such an approach would undermine their long- term
    prospects of pursuing their goals. </dd>
  <dt><a href="problem/scaleup.htm" name="scaleup"><strong>Scale-Up Problem</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Typically efforts to transform intractable relationships and negotiate dispute
    settlements take place in carefully facilitated small-group settings. However, these
    conflicts generally involve large segments of the population-- far more people than could
    ever be involved in such small group processes. This means that participants in small
    group processes must be able to &quot;scale-up&quot; their experiences or risk being

    succeed, even when the potential for a win-win outcome exists.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="powerimb"></a><a href="problem/powerimb.htm">Power Imbalances </a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Mediators often argue that in mediation, the parties all have equal power. However, this
    is seldom true. If one disputant has much more power than another in the outside world,
    this will be true at the negotiating table as well. Although an agreement may still be
    reached, it is likely to mirror the outside power distribution of the parties. This is
    true outside of negotiation as well, as higher-power parties tend to prevail in most
    decision-making systems. </dd>

    Credible</a></strong> </dt>
  <dd>Sometimes negotiation will be started with a third-party mediator, but that mediator
    lacks the ability or credibility to work effectively with all of the parties. If parties
    do not trust the mediator's fairness, they are likely to withdraw from the negotiation. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a name="medfail"></a><a href="problem/failmed.htm">Failed Mediation</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>If mediation is tried and fails because of poor timing, poor process, or a poor
    mediator, disputants may be unwilling to try it again, even when conditions are better. </dd>
