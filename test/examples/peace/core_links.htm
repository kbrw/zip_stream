<h3><a href="problem/force.htm"><strong>General Information about Problems with the Use of
Force and Threat</strong></a></h3>

<h3><a HREF="problem/illegit_force.htm"><strong>Backlash </strong></a></h3>

<p>Force-based strategies assume that an opponents will quickly submit to demands of
opponents thereby providing a quick route to victory. While force may succeed over the
short term, it often generates a powerful backlash or retaliation, as people hate to be
forced to do things against their will. This is especially true when victims of force
believe that the use of force was illegitimate. In this situations, the losing party is
likely to try to build up their own forcing power in hopes of challenging the victor at
the earliest possible opportunity. The result is likely to be a long-term intensification
of the conflict, rather than resolution. more detailed description, including information

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/counthrt.htm">Counter-Threats and Arms Races</a></strong></h3>

<p>Often disputants respond to force-based threats with counter threats rather than
submission. Such threats and counter threats can result in intense efforts by both parties
to increase their ability to use force against the other. In military situations, this is
called an &quot;arms race.&quot; Similar dynamics can arise with legal, political, or
other types of force as well. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link:GRIT Generalized De-escalation;

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/defy.htm">Defiance</a></strong></h3>

<p>The costs of using force-based threats increases dramatically when the opponent
responds to a threat with defiance rather than submission. This forces the threatening
party to carry out the threat or admit that it was all a meaningless bluff. Carrying out a
threat is likely to result in an expensive, destructive, and rapidly escalating
confrontation, while withdrawing the threat is likely to undermine a party's ability to
use threat and force-based strategies in the future.<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Solution Link: INSERT.

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/foropi-p.htm">Failure of the Disputants to Recognize Their
Own Force-based Options </a></strong></h3>

<p>There are many different types of force, each with their own advantages and
disadvantages. In order to be assured of the best possible strategy, the disputants need
to examine the full range of available options, including non-traditional options (such as
non-violent resistance), which are often highly promising, even though they are less
frequently used. Non-traditional options can be especially important to disempowered and
oppressed groups that may not recognize the powers of force that they have available for
protecting their interests. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Solution Link: Option Inventory. Example Links:INSERT" --></strong> <em>For more

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/worstop.htm">Assuming the Worst Possible Opponent</a></strong></h3>

<p>Disputants often take the worst possible view of their opponents' intentions and
strategies. They may assume, for instance, that their opponent will quickly turn to
violence or other form of force, and thus they feel they must be prepared to resist, no
matter what happens. This often leads disputants to take more forceful actions of their
own. Opponents are, however, likely to interpret these actions as unnecessarily
aggressive, and use them to justify their own worst-case planning. In addition, disputants
sometimes assume that all of their opponents approach the conflict in the same way. If one
group of extremists, for example, gets a lot of coverage in the press, it is often assumed
that all of one's opponents are equally extreme. Usually, however, there is a great deal
of variation in the motivations of a group of advocates. A failure to employ different
strategies for individuals with different characteristics is likely to significantly
reduce one's effectiveness. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Solution Links:Communication Improvement Strategies;

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/costfrc.htm">Neglecting Costs and Risks of Using Force</a></strong></h3>

<p>Parties often decide to pursue force-based strategies based on optimistic assumptions
about the likely costs and probability of success. Leaders often encourage their
supporters to make optimistic assumptions as a way of building support for a particular
strategy. However, this process may lead the disputants to greatly underestimate the costs
and risks of force, resulting in a poor choice of confrontation strategies. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/forconly.htm">Assuming Force is the only Possible Response</a></strong></h3>

<p>Faced with a difficult conflict, disputants sometimes overlook the possibility of using
negotiation or persuasion to improve the situation, relying instead on force. This is
especially likely to occurs when force has already been used by the other side. In this
case, the most common reaction is to respond with force. However, this type of response is
likely to escalate the situation, while other options might protect your interests just as
well, without making matters worse.<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Solution Link: Option Inventory. Example

<p>In this situation, a disputant believes that persuasive efforts are pointless because
the most visible opponents seem completely unpersuadable. In reality, an opponent's

<h3><a HREF="problem/batna.htm"><strong>Limits to Agreement: Better Alternatives</strong></a></h3>

<p>Opportunities for a resolving a dispute by voluntary agreement are limited by the

accept any agreement that is worse for them than the outcome which they think they can
obtain in another way. For example, if a negotiated agreement requires compromises that
they think they can avoid with a show of force, force will likely be used instead of
negotiation Sometimes, however, parties have unreasonable expectations of what they stand
to achieve from either negotiation or the continuation of the conflict. If they think they
can win more by continuing the conflict than is possible in any circumstance, they may
continue to pursue the conflict, even when it will actually do them more harm than good. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/missripe.htm">Overlooking Ripe Moments for Negotiation</a></strong></h3>

<p>The opposite problem occurs when disputants do not recognize that a conflict is
&quot;ripe&quot; for negotiation. They may be so entrenched in their confrontational
strategy that they may ignore situations when negotiation would be likely successful. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/scaleup.htm">Scale-Up Problem</a></strong></h3>

<p>Typically efforts to transform intractable relationships and negotiate dispute
settlements take place in carefully facilitated small group settings. However, these
conflicts generally involve large segments of the population far more people than could
ever be involved in such small group processes. This means that participants in small
group processes must be able to &quot;scale-up&quot; their experiences or risk being
disowned by their constituents. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Solution Link: Constituent Involvement Strategies" --></strong>;<strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/nonegat.htm">Fear of Forced Compromise</a></strong></h3>

<p><strong>Refusal to Negotiate</strong> Another important obstacle in successful
negotiation is the common refusal of the parties to come to the negotiating table. In some
cases this refusal to negotiate results from the parties' fear that they will be forced to
accept unwanted compromises. In other case the parties believe that negotiations are a
waste of time since they will require substantial resource commitments and are doomed to
failure. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link: Getting People to the Table; Identifying Negotiable Sub

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/nonegat1.htm">Hate-Based Refusal to Negotiate</a></strong></h3>

<p>Parties to a protracted, escalated conflict may be so angry with each other that they
will not pursue or accept a mutually beneficial agreement, because they do not want to do
anything that will help their opponent. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link: Third Party Intervention;

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/noexper.htm">Inexperienced Parties</a></strong></h3>

<p>Negotiation is a social process in which training and experience increases
effectiveness. This may place less experienced parties at a considerable disadvantage when
they negotiate with more experienced parties. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link: Training; Getting

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/nonegiss.htm">Attempting to Negotiate Non-negotiable Issues</a></strong></h3>

<p>When people try to negotiate non-negotiable issues--and fail--they often lose faith in
the negotiation process completely. This sometimes makes them unwilling to try negotiation
for anything, even when it is likely to work. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link: Negotiating

cannot succeed, even when the potential for a win-win outcome exists.<strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Solution

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/powerimb.htm">Power Imbalances </a></strong></h3>

<p>Mediators often argue that in mediation, the parties all have equal power. However,
this is seldom true. If one disputant has much more power than another in the outside
world, this will be true at the negotiating table as well. Although an agreement may still
be reached, it is likely to mirror the outside power distribution of the parties. This is
true outside of negotiation as well, as higher-power parties tend to prevail in most
decision making systems. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link: Empowerment; Example Links: 858; 1249;2278;

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/wrongpty.htm">Wrong (or Missing) Parties at the Table</a></strong></h3>

<p>If negotiation or mediation is undertaken with the wrong parties at the negotiating
table, the results will not be successful. Typical problems are that the people at the
table do not really represent the constituencies or groups that they are supposed to
represent, or they do not have decision making authority, or even links to it. Another
problem is that critical parties are missing from the table--either because they were not
invited, or because they chose not to come. Either way, this is likely to cause problems
later on when a decision is reached which does not represent the interests of all the
concerned or affected groups. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Solution Link:Identifying and Involving All

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/bad3pty.htm">Third Party Not Effective or Credible</a></strong>
</h3>

<p>Sometime negotiation will be started with a third party mediator, but that mediator
lacks the ability or credibility to work effectively with all of the parties. If parties
do not trust the mediator's fairness, they are likely to withdraw from the negotiation. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution
