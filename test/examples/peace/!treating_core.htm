    Prosecution</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Criminal prosecution is one strategy for dealing with war crimes and other
    excessive violence related to protracted conflicts. When successfully used it makes people
    responsible for what they did; it brings some sense of justice to a society; and it gives

    of guilt, the paying of reparations, the asking of forgiveness, and the granting of
    amnesty. Like criminal prosecution, this approach has its costs and benefits--both
    practical and moral.</big></dd>
  <dt><big><a name="truth_com"></a><a href="treatment/truth_com.htm"><strong><strong>Truth
    Commissions</strong></strong></a></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Truth commissions are used following periods of human rights abuses and war crimes
    to publicly and permanently document what actually happened. These efforts, which can be
    combined with forgiveness and amnesty programs, provide some measure of justice and help
    build support for programs designed to prevent such occurrences in the future.&nbsp; They

<p><big><em>The following seven items are listed both as problems and as treatments, as
they can be either, depending on the situation.&nbsp; The write-ups indicate how these
concepts can be seen both ways.</em> </big>

<dl>
  <dt><big><a name="submit"></a><strong><a href="problem/submission.htm">Submission</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>In cases where people are subjected to overwhelming force which they do not have
    the power to resist, it may be most appropriate to simply accept defeat and try (at least
    over the short term) to make the best of a bad situation.</big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="subvert"></a><a href="problem/subversion.htm">Subversion</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Often, people who are being subjected to force pretend that they are submitting to
    the demands of the forcing or threatening party, when in reality they are pursuing a
    deceptive strategy which allows them to avoid complying with those demands.</big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="defy"></a><a href="problem/defy.htm">Defiance</a> </strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>The cost of using force-based threats increases dramatically when the opponent
    responds to a threat with defiance rather than submission. This forces the threatening
    party to carry out the threat or admit that it was a bluff. Carrying out a threat is
    likely to result in an expensive, destructive, and rapidly escalating confrontation, while
    withdrawing the threat is likely to undermine a party's ability to use threat and
    force-based strategies in the future.</big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="Defense"></a><a href="problem/defense.htm">Defense</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Defense is a strategy which allows people to prevent others from successfully using
    force against them. Successful defense strategies do not, however, give the defending
    party the ability to successfully use force against their opponents<font color="#800000">.
    </font></big></dd>
  <dt><big><a name="Coalition"></a><a href="problem/coalition.htm"><strong>Coalition Building</strong></a></big></dt>
  <dd><big>People can build their power base and their ability to pursue (or resist)
    force-based strategies by building coalitions with people with complementary interests.
    Members of these coalitions promise to help each other advance their interests and defend
    themselves from external force-based strategies. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="counthrt"></a><a href="problem/counthrt.htm">Deterrence,
    Counter-Threats, and Arms Races</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Often disputants respond to force-based threats with counter-threats rather than
    submission. Such threats and counter threats can result rapid escalation of a conflict.
    &nbsp; In military situations, this is called an &quot;arms race.&quot; Similar dynamics
    can arise with legal, political, or other types of force as well. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="flight"></a><a href="problem/flight.htm">Flight (Refugees)</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Another possible response to overwhelming force is flight, in which the parties
    simply flee the area. It is this strategy which is responsible for the large numbers of
    refugees who flee the world's trouble spots. </big></dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <hr>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="extintvn"></a><a href="treatment/extintvn.htm">External
    Intervention</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>External intervention is the involvement of an external power (another country, for
    example) in an internal struggle or conflict. This intervention can be military or
    nonmilitary. Among the non-military options are positive or negative sanctions (rewards or
    punishments for certain behaviors), mediation, and peacekeeping. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="arbitrat"></a><a href="treatment/arbitrat.htm">Arbitration</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Arbitration is a form of third-party intervention in which the parties voluntarily
    submit their dispute to a trusted outsider who hears all sides of the story and then makes
    a decision which the parties have promised to accept.&nbsp; (Although the parties enter
    arbitration voluntarily, the binding outcome forces one side to do something it probably
    wouldn't otherwise do--hence we put arbitration in the &quot;force&quot; category.)</big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="disarm"></a><a href="treatment/disarmament.htm">Disarmament
    Strategies</a> </strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Counterforce strategies frequently lead to an arms race, in which parties acquire
    huge military arsenals which are often kept on near-permanent alert so that a relatively
    minor provocation can quickly escalate into an all-out military confrontation. Disarmament
    and arms control efforts are key to reducing the dangers associated with this situation.</big></dd>
  <dt><big><a name="lefitfc"></a><a href="treatment/lefitfc.htm"><strong>Legitimizing the Use
    of Force</strong></a></big></dt>
  <dd><big>In the development and implementation of force-based strategies, there are a number
    of steps which the parties can take to increase the legitimacy of their actions, and
    reduce the risk of backlash. Most of these involve limiting the extent and type of force,
    and linking force to other power options, especially integrative and exchange
    (negotiation) options. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="pkeeping"></a><a href="treatment/pkeeping.htm">Peacekeeping</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Peacekeeping involves putting neutral intermediaries between fighting factions to
    physically keep them apart. This can cool down a conflict enough to allow for successful
    peace making (the development of a settlement agreement) and long-term peacebuilding (the
    re-establishment of normal relations).</big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="shortcut"></a><a href="treatment/shortcut.htm">Forcing Power
    Shortcuts </a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Forcing power shortcuts are designed to provide the parties with accurate and
    low-cost forecasts of the likely outcome of pursuing forcing-power contests to their
    ultimate conclusion. By using shortcuts, however, the terrible costs of protracted power
    contests can be avoided. These forecasts can then be used as a basis for negotiation.
    Examples of such shortcuts include: public opinion polls (in place of elections);
    arbitration or mini-trials (in place of litigation); and relative military force
    assessments (in place of military confrontations).</big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="negloopb"></a><a href="treatment/negloopb.htm">Step-By-Step
    Application of Force With Negotiation Loop-Backs</a><font color="#800000"><em> </em></font></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Force and loopback processes can be employed in a step-by-step fashion in which a
    party begins with a modest demonstration of the force-based power and then attempts to
    negotiate to see if some type of acceptable agreement on the immediate dispute might be
    possible. If agreement is not possible, they can then step up the use of force and repeat
    the process. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="facsavsr"></a><a href="treatment/facsavsr.htm">Face-Saving </a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Losing parties are much more likely to agree to end a struggle if they are given a
    way out of the situation that is not terribly embarrassing, and does not force them to
    admit they lost. If there is some way to frame the outcome of the dispute so all sides can
    claim at least some success, it will make it much easier for the losing side to back down.</big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="reloser"></a><a href="treatment/reloser.htm">Re-Integration of
    Losers</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>It also is important that losing parties be reintegrated into the society. People
    do not just go away, but they must continue to live somewhere--most often where they have
    been living before. For this reason, disputes must end with a plan that specifies how all
    the parties will live together in the future.</big></dd>

  <dd><big>The first step towards effective utilization of integrative power is identifying
    ways it can be used to constructively transform conflicts.</big></dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="opencomm"></a><a href="treatment/opencomm.htm">Opening
    Communication Channels</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Another early step toward making almost any integrative strategy work is opening
    the communication channels through which integration can take place. Persuasion and
    conflict transformation are impossible if people are not listening. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="usepersn"></a><a href="treatment/usepersn.htm">Crafting Persuasive
    Arguments</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Successful persuasion requires showing opponents how changing their position
    advances the common interest that all parties have in a strong integrative system. The
    best persuasive arguments are built around common values--things that almost everyone
    would agree on.</big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="amensty2"></a><a href="treatment/amnesty.htm">Apology and
    Forgiveness </a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>In many serious conflicts, one or more parties may have committed horrible crimes
    or atrocities. In&nbsp; less serious cases, the parties are likely to have done things
    which opponents find extremely hurtful. In these cases, an integrative approach which
    focuses upon the acknowledgment of past guilt, the payment of appropriate compensation,
    and the granting of forgiveness, can do much to help the parties strengthen their
    relationship and&nbsp; the integrative system.&nbsp; Formalized structures to elicit
    apologies and forgiveness, such as the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission,
    can help communities torn apart by violent confrontations recover from the crimes and
    atrocities which occurred. These commissions can provide a formal mechanism to publicly
    account for what happened, apologize and forgive. This can be very helpful in the overall
    peacebuilding process, allowing reconciliation between previously warring groups </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="hypocrsy"></a><a href="treatment/hypocrsy.htm">Confronting
    Hypocrisy</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>In cases where people act in violation of their cultural values and beliefs, direct
    confrontation of their hypocrisy can serve as a basis for persuasive appeals. The key is
    to construct a situation in which is it impossible for the parties to ignore the hypocrisy
    of their own actions. Such actions might, for example, involve carefully-structured public
    demonstrations such as those led by Gandhi and King. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="commony"></a><a href="treatment/commony.htm">Finding Commonality</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>In the rush to strengthen group identities, many minority (as well as some majority
    groups) fail to&nbsp; recognize the importance of areas of commonality between groups,
    especially cross-cultural principles of fairness which are capable of binding a diverse
    society together. Developing such integrative principles&nbsp; can provide a basis for
    transforming many cross-cultural conflicts into conflicts which strengthen societies
    instead of tearing them apart. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="humanztn"></a><a href="treatment/humanism.htm">Humanization</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>This is the reversal of dehumanization.&nbsp; With humanization, people try to
    counter enemy images and negative stereotypes, emphasizing the humanity of all people and
    the importance of treating others fairly based on their humanness. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="tolerate"></a><a href="treatment/tolerate.htm">Coexistence and
    Tolerance</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>The principles of coexistence and tolerance are important as a basis for building
    mutually acceptable relationships between highly diverse communities within a larger
    society. As such, these principles can contribute significantly to the strengthening of
    the integrative system. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="trustbld"></a><a href="treatment/trustbld.htm">Trust Building </a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>In prolonged and escalated conflicts, distrust is inevitable, and it significantly
    hampers the ability of the parties to negotiate even a partial solution to their problems.
    A variety of trust-building measures are available to slowly build up trust so that more
    cooperative problem-solving approaches can take place. In addition, implementation plans
    can be developed that largely eliminate the need for trust, by being self-enforcing. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="facesav"></a><a href="treatment/facesavr.htm">Face Saving</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Face saving is a strategy for limiting the sacrifice trap by making it easier for a
    party to change its behavior without overtly admitting that they made a mistake in the
    past. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="recocil"></a><a href="treatment/recocil.htm">Reconciliation </a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Reconciliation strategies are designed to resolve the underlying conflict, rather
    than settle the immediate dispute episode. They require the parties to reconcile their
    underlying differences and transform their relationship to that of &quot;normalcy&quot;.
    This is a long, slow process involving trust-building, apology, forgiveness, and a variety
    of other peace-building measures. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="moralhg"></a><a href="treatment/moralhg.htm">Moral High Ground </a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>A party's integrative power can often be strengthened by consistently adhering to
    high moral principles and refusing to employ tempting, but immoral or escalating tactics
    such as personal attacks, deceit, or gloating. By &quot;playing fairly,&quot; parties can
    do much to enhance their own legitimacy and hence their ability to persuade their more
    reasonable opponents and transform the conflict into a more constructive one. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="cminst-s"></a><a href="treatment/cminst-s.htm">Re-Establish or
    Empower Traditional or New Conflict-Management Institutions </a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Every society has its own, traditional ways of managing and resolving conflicts,
    although these can become dysfunctional at times of protracted and severe conflict. By
    re-establishing or empowering institutions such as the family, the clan, the church, or
    the community to provide conflict management assistance, the integrative system can be
    strengthened and some aspects of an intractable conflict can be transformed and/or
    resolved.</big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="jointprt"></a><a href="treatment/jointprt.htm">Joint Projects </a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>One technique for peacebuilding and reconciliation is to engage in joint projects
    with people on the other side of a conflict. If opponents can be brought together in some
    cooperative endeavor, they tend to break down their negative stereotypes, begin to depend
    on each other, and start building normal, positive relationships which can later be
    extended to issues in conflict. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="peacebld"></a><a href="treatment/peacebld.htm">Peacebuilding -
    Official Efforts of UN and Regional Organizations</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Peacebuilding is the process of rebuilding normal relations between people who have
    been at war with each other, either literally or figuratively. It involves rebuilding
    trust, re-establishing cooperative relationships, apologizing for past violent deeds and
    forgiving those deeds so that the former enemies can become friends and neighbors, who can
    successfully live and work together in the future. Though peacebuilding is a process that
    must involve all citizens, not just the elite, efforts to initiate peacebuilding
    activities are often undertaken by UN peacekeeping teams and/or teams from regional
    organizations such as the Organization of African States. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="ngopb"></a><a href="treatment/ngopb.htm">NGO Peacebuilding </a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Nongovernmental organizations can also play a major intermediary role encouraging
    peacebuilding in war-torn societies. Unlike peacemaking (which is attaining a short-term
    settlement) or peacekeeping (which just keeps the parties apart), peacebuilding works to
    re-establish trust and a sense of community and normalcy between previously warring
    groups.&nbsp; </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="ngoaid"></a><a href="treatment/ngoaid.htm">NGO Humanitarian Aid</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>In addition to offering peacebuilding activities, NGOs often provide humanitarian
    aid. While this is generally not considered a form of conflict management, it does provide
    fundamental human needs and empowers people enough so that they can begin to undertake a
    peacebuilding process. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="citdip"></a><a href="treatment/citdip.htm">Citizen Diplomacy </a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>In addition to traditional diplomacy of government officials, private citizens can
    engage in discussions about their conflict situations. Such discussions can focus on
    improving interpersonal understanding and trust between groups, or they can go so far as
    to explore options for dispute settlement. Often citizens can say things and suggest ideas
    that formal diplomats cannot, which can lead to the development of innovative approaches
    to intractable problems. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="church"></a><a href="treatment/church.htm">Church Involvement </a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Religion is a very strong integrative factor for most people, although it can be
    divisive as well when different religious groups oppose each other. A few religions--the
    Quakers and the Mennonites, for example, have a strong tradition of peacebuilding around
    the globe. Most other religions value human life and peace in some way as well. If these
    teachings can be emphasized, churches can go a long way toward bringing people together. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="comvalu"></a><a href="treatment/comvalu.htm">Finding Common Values
    </a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Most intractable conflicts involve fundamental value disagreements of some kind.
    However, there are usually additional values that both sides have in common--for instance
    the value of peace, or the value of human life. Sometimes a third party can help
    disputants identify such common values and reframe their disagreement in a way that can
    help both groups work together to attain these values, rather than focusing on the areas
    of disagreement.</big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="powerss"></a><a href="treatment/powrshar.htm">Power Sharing&nbsp;
    and Autonomy Strategies</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Many intractable disputes involve what we call &quot;domination conflicts.&quot; In
    this situation, one group dominates another, which does not want to be subordinate to the
    first group. Conflict is likely to continue as long as either group pursues domination.
    However, if the groups can agree on some principles of power sharing and/or autonomy,
    domination conflicts can be mitigated and eventually resolved. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="dialogue"></a><a href="treatment/dialog2.htm">Dialogue </a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Dialogue is a process in which parties engage in deep and meaningful conversations
    with their opponents, not for the purpose of resolving a dispute (as is usually true with
    negotiation or mediation), but rather for the purpose of developing a better understanding
    of the people &quot;on the other side.&quot; Through dialogue, disputants break down
    negative stereotypes, focus on deep-rooted feelings, values, and needs, and come to
    understand the complexity of the conflict and the issues on all sides.</big></dd>

    Thus the development of interdependence is an escalation-avoidance strategy. It is also an
    approach to de-escalate a conflict, as interdependence encourages cooperation, which then

    unthinkable had the stereotype been true. Sometimes called &quot;disarming&quot; moves
    (though they have nothing to do with military disarmament), these are actions that are
    surprisingly reasonable. They help break down negative stereotypes as they prove that the

    Essentially it involves two or more parties working together to examine their interests
    and needs, and working out a solution that will give the best possible outcome to both
    sides.&nbsp; This can be done cooperatively, as it is in principled negotiation, or it can
    be done in a competitive way as is typical in distributive bargaining.</big></dd>

    management and conflict resolution processes. While official diplomacy faces many

    mutually beneficial agreements on some issues, even while they struggle with the serious
    unresolved conflicts in other areas.</big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="ngloops"></a><a href="treatment/ngloops.htm">Negotiation Loopbacks

  <dd><big>Often disputing parties will attempt negotiations to resolve a conflict, but one
    (or more) parties will drop out of the negotiations because they think they can get a
    better outcome using another approach (which usually involves some form of force).
    However, the force-based strategy does not need to be pursued to the
    &quot;bitter-end.&quot; Rather, once the relative power of the parties is clear, the
    disputants can return to negotiation to peacefully implement an agreement that reflects
    the true power relationships of the parties at that time. </big></dd>

    Negotiation</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Principled negotiation, described by Fisher and Ury in <em>Getting to Yes</em><strong>,
    </strong>is a four-step negotiation strategy based on interests. In cases where there are
    reasonable prospects for an agreement which benefits all parties, and the parties have a
    relationship which allows them to explore such opportunities, principled negotiation can
    be an extremely effective conflict resolution approach.</big></dd>

  <dd><big>Soft bargaining is a negotiation strategy in which primary emphasis is on the
    preservation of friendly relationships with the other parties. While this approach reduces
    the level of conflict, it also increases the risk that one party will be exploited by
    others who use hard bargaining techniques. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="hardbarc"></a><a href="treatment/hardbarc.htm">Hard Bargaining </a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Hard bargaining strategies emphasize results over relationships. Hard bargainers
    will insist that their demands be completely agreed to and accepted before any agreement
    is possible. While this approach avoids the need to make concessions, it also reduces the
    likelihood of successfully negotiating an agreement, and usually harms the relationship
    with the other party as well. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><a name="distbarg"></a><a href="treatment/distbarg.htm"><strong>Distributive
    Bargaining</strong></a></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Distributive bargaining is an alternative to principled negotiation in which the
    parties assume that the conflict is structured in a win-lose way and the best strategy is
    to bargain over who is going to get how much. Distributive bargaining tends to be much
    more competitive and adversarial than principled negotiation, as each party tries to do
    better than the others in the negotiation.</big></dd>

    negotiation can be more effective if the negotiators try to develop &quot;yesable
    propositions.&quot;</big></dd>

    Intervention </a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>In cases where the parties are unable to negotiate, or even communicate effectively
    with one another, a trusted intermediary can play an important role in helping the parties
    communicate more effectively. Third parties can also provide mediation or arbitration (see
    below). Even when conflicts are being confronted, not resolved, third parties can help
    both parties confront the issues more effectively than they could alone. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="mediatn"></a><a href="treatment/mediatn.htm">Mediation</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Mediation is a form of third-party intervention in which the mediator helps the
    parties negotiate an agreement which they then have the option of accepting or rejecting.
    In some cases, mediators play a problem-solving role focused upon negotiating an agreement
    to the immediate dispute. In other cases mediation focuses more upon improving
    relationships, with the assumption that the improved relationship will lead to conflict
    resolution or constructive confrontation.</big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="consens"></a><a href="treatment/consens.htm">Consensus Building </a></strong></big></dt>

    conflict-of-interest and work for a solution that favors themselves and/or one side of the
    conflict more than the other, or they may not have the skills necessary to intervene
    successfully. By providing a third party who is skilled and credible, these problems can
    be surmounted, and often significant progress can be made where none was made before. </big></dd>

  <dd><big>When new people enter a negotiation or become leaders of a group involved in an
    ongoing conflict, it is essential that they be fully briefed about the history of the
    conflict and conflict management processes. Although it is inevitable that the new people
    will not see things exactly the same way as the people they replace, less disruption of
    the conflict management process will occur if the new people at least enter the process
    understanding what is going on and what has gone on before. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="comgrd"></a><a href="treatment/comgrd.htm">Common Ground Projects </a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Common ground projects do not attempt to resolve a conflict's core issues. Instead
    they focus upon identifying points of common ground or areas in which the parties can
    agree. This can then provide a basis for transforming relationships, which will eventually
    allow the parties to more constructively address the more difficult core issues in
    dispute. </big></dd>

    can help assure parties that the provisions of an agreement will be carried out. This can
    reduce the risk that a lack of trust between the parties will block an agreement that
    would otherwise benefit all the parties.&nbsp; Deadlines within the negotiation process
    can also assure that a party who prefers maintaining the status quo cannot delay the
    negotiations indefinitely. When the parties' distrust each other's willingness to keep
    commitments, it is also possible to design a settlement that has agreements that are
    dependent upon the other parties' performance, which also reduces the need for trust to
    finalize any agreement. </big></dd>

  <dd><big>Brainstorming is a process in which the parties are asked to&nbsp; generate as many
    options for approaching a problem as they can. People are encouraged to think creatively
    and build off each others' ideas--without critically examining any of the ideas until
    later. The goal is to come up with new ways of approaching problems from those which had

    negotiation before the &quot;real&quot; negotiations take place.&nbsp; In pre-negotiation,
    disputants can decide who is going to be at the table, what the agenda is going to be, how
    the negotiations will be structured, what the ground rules will be, etc.&nbsp; This can
    help the negotiations get started more effectively than if all of these matters are also
    in dispute when negotiations begin.&nbsp; </big></dd>

    involve their constituents in the process. This is critical, since constituents are less
    likely to accept an agreement that is obtained if they have not be involved in the process
    enough to understand why the agreement was designed as it was (especially why certain
    compromises were made) and why it is the best alternative available.</big></dd>

  <dd><big>Negotiation with illegitimate representatives seldom works. Parties involved in
    negotiation need to make sure that the people they are negotiating with really do
    represent the constituency they purport to represent. If they do not, it is essential to
    find out who does legitimately represent that group and negotiate with them. If a group
    has no legitimate leader, there is no point in negotiating until one can be established.</big></dd>

  <dt><big><strong><a name="empwrmt2"></a><a href="treatment/empower.htm">Empowerment</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>People or groups involved in intractable conflicts are almost always better off if
    they carefully assess their sources of power and build up those sources of power as much
    as possible before confronting their opponents. Empowerment also involves developing a
    strategy for using power wisely-- employing a mix of constructive confrontation techniques
    which are most likely to produce benefits with the lowest costs. (Keep in mind that
    &quot;power&quot; is being used here in a broad sense, to include exchange and integrative
    strategies as well as force). Empowerment is especially important to groups which start
    out in a low-power position, which puts them at a disadvantage in almost all
    confrontational situations. Negotiation, for example, often does not work well when the
    parties negotiating have extremely unequal power. Often third parties will undertake
    empowerment of the lower-power party in order to alleviate this situation.</big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="adavr"></a><a href="treatment/adavr.htm">Advocacy Advisors</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>While strategic planning can be done by disputing parties on their own, sometimes
    it is useful to obtain advice from an outside consultant, who can provide insight into
    different confrontation options. Advocacy advisors intervene in a conflict on behalf of
    one of the parties and not as a neutral intermediary. Their goal is to apply their
    knowledge of conflict processes to the party's effort to advance their own interests.
    Differing types of advocacy advisors specialize in different approaches to conflict. For
    example, lawyers specialize in litigation-based strategies, political advisors specialize
    in elections, lobbyists specialize in influencing the legislative process, labor
    organizers specialize in strikes and other job actions, and community organizers
    specialize in non-violent direct action, while religious leaders specialize in moral
    arguments and military advisors specialized in armed conflict. There can also be general
    advocacy advisors who show the parties how all of these strategies might be used in
    combination.</big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="goalcfn"></a><a href="treatment/goalclar.htm">Goal Clarification</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>It is very difficult to succeed in a conflict if one is not clear from the outset
    about one's goals. One of the earliest steps in constructive confrontation is therefore
    the clarification of one's goals to determine exactly what the problem is and what
    solution is sought. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="ipmedtn"></a><a href="treatment/ipmedtn.htm">Insider-Partial
    Mediation</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Although the North American model of mediation relies on an outsider, impartial
    mediator, in other societies, people who are connected to the conflict, and even partial
    to one side, are often more effective mediators, as they are trusted by the people to be
    fair and to be committed to fair agreement which they will help implement and enforce. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="psmix"></a><a href="treatment/psmix.htm">Identify Sources of
    Power/Power Strategy Mix</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Usually, using several power strategies in combination is more effective than using
    just one approach alone. Careful framing, the control of complicating problems, and the
    use of forcing, integrative, and trading power are much more effective when used in
    combination than when used separately. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="anps"></a><a href="treatment/anps.htm">Analytical Problem Solving </a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Analytical problem solving is an approach to difficult conflicts developed by
    conflict scholars John Burton, Herbert Kelman, and others which focuses upon
    systematically analyzing a conflict to determine the degree to which fundamental human
    needs of the parties are being met. In cases where there are significant unmet needs,
    analytical problem solving examines options for meeting those needs as a way of resolving
    the conflict. </big></dd>

    Transformation</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Many scholars and practitioners are beginning to focus more on the goal of
    transforming conflicts, rather than resolving them. Transformation refers to a change in
    the nature of the relationship between the disputing parties, not just a settlement of
    interest-based differences. The ultimate goal of conflict transformation is
    reconciliation--a return to normal relations between disputing groups where each side
    accepts the legitimacy of the other's identity and aspirations, apologizes for and
    forgives the other for&nbsp; past aggressive or violent acts.<strong> </strong></big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="contrns"></a><a href="treatment/tmedtn.htm" name="tmedtn">Transformative

  <dd><big>Transformative mediation, a concept developed by Baruch Bush and Joe Folger in the<strong>
    </strong><em>Promise of Mediation</em>, focuses on helping parties to transform their
    underlying relationship through empowerment and recognition. It is different from the more
    common problem-solving approach to mediation which emphasizes short term dispute
    settlement more than long-term relationships.</big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="dsd"></a><a href="treatment/dsd.htm">Dispute Systems Design </a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Dispute systems design is a concept developed in <em>Getting Disputes Resolved</em><strong>
    </strong>by William Ury , Jeanne Brett, and Stephen Goldberg. Dispute handling systems are
    designed for organizations and communities that have to deal with a continuing series of
    disputes over similar issues. The goal of dispute system design is to develop and
    implement a system which directs each dispute to the appropriate dispute handling process.
    While interest-based processes are best in most cases, Ury, Brett, and Goldberg recognize
    that there are also disputes which must be resolved on the basis of rights, as well as
    those which are resolved by determining who is more powerful. </big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="realtest"></a><a href="treatment/realtest.htm">Reality Testing </a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>In deciding which conflict management strategy is most promising, parties must make
    assumptions about their own power, their opponent's power, and the likely outcomes of
    different options. It is easy to make inaccurate assessments of any of these factors,
    however. Often an outside party can help review the accuracy of these assumptions and help
    parties revise them appropriately when they are invalid. </big></dd>

    Diplomacy/Conflict Prevention</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Preventative diplomacy or conflict prevention analyzes current problems and trends
    to identify situations which seem likely to escalate if not effectively managed. Steps can
    then be taken to remedy the situation before the conflict escalates so much that it
    becomes difficult to deal with. If successful, this approach can eliminate the need for
    dispute resolution activities by avoiding the conflict in the first place. </big></dd>

    Confrontation </a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Constructive confrontation is a strategy developed by Guy Burgess and Heidi Burgess
    which focuses upon helping the parties develop more constructive strategies for pursuing
    inevitable confrontations. It is an incremental approach which involves diagnosing
    particular conflict problems, and then designing remedies for those problems so that the
    resulting conflict is more constructive.</big></dd>
  <dt><big><strong><a name="train"></a><a href="treatment/train.htm">Training</a></strong></big></dt>
  <dd><big>Conflict management training can also serve as an intervention strategy. By helping
    people involved in conflicts better understand what is going on and what options they have
