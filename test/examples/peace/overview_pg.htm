<p>This website contains a set of materials designed to help people better deal with
difficult, long-lasting, and resolution-resistant conflicts. Some of the materials are
theoretical--they discuss the nature of conflicts and conflict processes, and they discuss
what conflict theory tells us about ways conflicts can be most constructively approached.
Other materials are practical. They discuss typical conflict problems and potential
solutions. While the practical material draws upon theory, it is largely based on
practical experience and is designed to provide solutions to particular problems.</p>

<h2><a name="Ways to Use"></a>The Ways in Which This Program Can be Used</h2>

<p><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="There wasa linkl to the waytouse.htm file which seems to be an outdated version of this so Guy deleted it." --></p>

<p>This program can be used in a variety of ways. It can be searched quickly to find a
solution to a particular problem. Or it can be studied in some detail--to learn more about
resolution-resistant conflicts in general and how they can be most effectively approached.
The program can be used by itself by people who have little or no experience in conflict
management. It can also be used, however, to supplement other conflict management training
or reading. Since we take a somewhat different approach to conflict management and
resolution than is common among our colleagues, the material on this website is likely to
give users a new perspective and additional ideas about how best to confront difficult
conflict situations.</p>

<p>All the information on this web-site is available for free. Users can study as much or
as little as they wish without incurring any costs (beyond computer access costs).
However, a certificate of completion and/or university credit is available (for a small
fee) for those who want to work through the formal course material and complete the
assignments. For more information on these options, choose one of the items below. 

<dl>
  <dt><a href="online_consulting.htm" name="on_own"><strong>On Your Own: &nbsp;
    Problem-Solution Essays</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Users who just want a quick answer to a particular problem can use the problem and
    solution sections to find essays on common conflict problems and possible solutions or
    treatments.&nbsp; Each problem and solution essay is linked to related problems,
    solutions, and examples, so users can follow &quot;strings&quot; (suggested paths) through
    the system to get as much or as little information as they would like.&nbsp; Users who
    want a more thorough understanding of intractable conflicts in general should read the
    training and education section, below.</dd>
  <dt><a href="training_options.htm" name="training"><strong>Online Training and Education</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>The training and education option is available for people who want more information
    about a broader range of topics.&nbsp; In addition to the problem and solution material
    discussed above, people wanting more extensive training or education should read the
    background theoretical essays, as well as the examples which are linked to the problem and
    solution essays. Users who want college credit or a certificate of completion must also
    complete a set of assignments and pay the appropriate fee.&nbsp; This fee will pay for
    instructor feedback, and a final certificate and/or college credit. However, people who do
    not need feedback or credit are welcome to use the system on their own.</dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dd>The core training program consists of ten basic units--one on introductory theory, and
    nine others, each focusing on a particular category of problem. Each unit has a overview
    section and a number of more specialized sub-sections describing common problems and
    potential solutions.&nbsp; Examples give more information about particular problems, or
    how solutions have been applied in different situations.&nbsp; Assignments ask students to
    apply some of the ideas from the essays to situations they are familiar with.</dd>

<h2><a name="Theory"></a>The Theoretical Ideas Underlying This Program</h2>

<p>The approach we take to deal with difficult and resolution-resistant conflicts draws
ideas from several fields. It draws heavily from the new fields of conflict resolution and
peace research, utilizing the wisdom of practitioners as well as scholars. It also draws
ideas from experts in advocacy, community organization, and nonviolent direct action.
Unlike those who seek resolution for the sake of resolution, we seek justice, fairness,
good decisions, and good solutions. Sometimes this means working to resolve a conflict,
while sometimes it means continuing the conflict, but doing so in a more constructive way.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
The following papers provide additional information the history of the field of conflict
resolution (which puts our work in its contexts), and about the approach we call
constructive confrontation. </p>

  <dd>Although all of the material is now available only in English, we have tried to write in
    a style that we hope will be understandable to people with limited English skills. An
    online dictionary provides definitions of specialized terms which may not be found in
    standard translations dictionaries. We are also including multilingual program
    descriptions.<font color="#800000"> </font>As a further translation aid, we have included
    a link to AltaVista's free online translation service. While this is primitive and should
    be used with caution, it may still be useful.</dd>

<h2><a name="Developers"></a>The People and Organizations Who Developed and Funded This
Program</h2>

<dl>
  <dt><strong><a href="crc_org.htm">University of Colorado Conflict Research Consortium</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>This program has been developed by the University of Colorado Conflict Research
    Consortium, a university-based research program in the United States, specializing in
    improving the understanding of and ability to handle resolution-resistant conflicts. In
    addition to focusing on intractable conflicts, the Consortium has worked for many years to
    assemble what we consider to be the core knowledge of the conflict resolution field and to
    present that knowledge in a format that is readily accessible and understandable to the
    general public. Earlier efforts to do this involved development of conflict resolution
    bibliographies, and an <a href="http://www.Colorado.EDU/conflict/encyann.htm"><em>Encyclopedia
    of Conflict Resolution</em></a>, written by Heidi Burgess and Guy Burgess and published by
    ABC-CLIO in 1997.&nbsp; The Consortium also maintains one of the most extensive web-sites
    on conflict resolution available on the World-Wide Web&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.colorado.edu/conflict">http://www.colorado.edu/conflict</a>).</dd>
  <dt><strong><a href="bios.htm">The People Who Developed This Program</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>This program has been developed by Guy Burgess, Heidi Burgess, and Paul Wehr. Guy
    Burgess and Heidi Burgess are Co-Directors of the University of Colorado Conflict Research
    Consortium, a university-based research program specializing in improving our
    understanding of and ability to handle resolution-resistant conflicts. Paul Wehr, a
    professor of Sociology, is also a founding member of the Consortium and has been an active
    member of the Intractable Conflict research program for many years. </dd>
  <dt><strong><a href="program_funders.htm">The Organizations Which Funded This Program</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>This development of this program has been funded by the U.S. Institute of Peace, the
    William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, and the University of Colorado.</dd>
