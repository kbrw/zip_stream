<h3><strong><a href="treatment/borrowid.htm">Finding and Borrowing Eloquent Statements of
the Common Core Issues </a></strong></h3>

<p>One way to clarify the core issues is for the parties to review eloquent statements
from prominent individuals who have struggled with similar problems and found a compelling
way to state the core issues. If one of these statements seems to reflect their situation
it could be modified to fit their situation.<em> For more information about this approach

<h3><a href="treatment/intframe.htm"><strong>Interested-Based Framing</strong></a></h3>

<p>Interest-based framing describes conflicts in terms of interests, rather than
positions. Often, interests are compatible, even when positions are not. Thus
interest-based framing enables the parties to identify win-win solutions to problems that
might not have been evidence when the issues were described in terms of the parties'
positions. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Links: Confusing interests with Positions; overly simple image

<h3><a href="treatment/fairfram.htm"><strong>Fairness-based Framing</strong></a></h3>

<p>In fairness-based framing the parties approach the conflict as an effort to obtain what
is rightfully theirs. In doing this, they base their arguments on principles of fairness
which are accepted by the larger society, as well as their more reasonable opponents. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/mirror.htm">Mirror Imaging</a></strong></h3>

<p>Mirror imaging is a strategy which parties can use to assess the reasonableness of
their behavior. It asks the parties to look at themselves the way others see them and make
appropriate changes if they do not like what they see. Often if disputants will look at
themselves honestly, they will sometimes notice that they are doing the same kinds of
things--name calling, deception, and rumor spreading, for example--that they fault their
opponents for doing. Once this is understood, parties can change their behavior to appear
more reasonable, without altering or undermining their true interests at all.<strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/acceptst.htm">Accepting Rather Than Challenging the
Situation </a></strong></h3>

<p>All grievances and complaints do not have to be framed as conflicts. Often it is wiser
for the parties to conclude that the issue is not important enough to justify the cost of
confrontation. In such cases, the issue can be resolved by simply &quot;agreeing to
disagree&quot; or accepting the situation as another disagreeable, but unavoidable, fact
of life. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: INSERT. Example Link: 3401" --><strong> </strong><em>For more information about this approach &quot;click&quot; on the

<p>This approach frames a conflict as a collective effort to fulfill the fundamental human

the approach can sharply reduce the level of conflict. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Links: Confusing

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/powrshar.htm">Power Sharing</a></strong></h3>

<p>Power sharing is a strategy for resolving disputes over who should have the most
powerful position in the social hierarchy. Instead of fighting over who should have power
over whom, power sharing relies upon the joint exercise of power. If conflicts can be
reframed to focus on how such power sharing might take place, they can become much more
constructive. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Links: Domination Conflicts; Power Imbalances. Example

<p>When opponents in a conflict each define, or frame, the conflict in very different
terms it can make cooperative problem solving very difficult. An exercise in joint
reframing can help each side see the conflict as the other side sees it, which can help
both sides confront the situation in a more constructive way. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link:Incompatible Frames

seeking an outside consultant to help them analyze the conflict; it can also be done with
the other parties present in the context of mediation or consensus building, as is done in

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/wwrefram.htm">Integrative (or win-win) Reframing</a></strong></h3>

<p>Conflicts can often be defined in a variety of ways. When conflicts are being
approached as unavoidable win-lose situations, it is often useful to ask whether it is
possible to redefine the situation so that integrative (or win-win) solutions can be
obtained. This is especially important when the original problem definition leaves no
acceptable alternatives for the opponent. Although integrative reframing is not always
possible, often it is possible to reframe at least part of the conflict in this way. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="

<p>A careful effort to identify all current and potential parties is necessary for

hidden. Efforts should be made to figure out who might be affected by the outcome to a
particular conflict as well as who is currently concerned about the situation but has not
yet become vocal.<strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Problem Links: Excluded Parties. Example Link: 7278." --> </strong><em>For more

<h2><strong>TREATING COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS</strong></h2>

<hr>

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/comm-s.htm">General Comments about Treating Communication
Problems</a></strong></h3>

<p>Although improving communication will seldom (perhaps never) completely resolve an
intractable conflict, communication improvements can often make the situation better or
more constructive. (On occasion, it should be noted, better communication can make things
worse, if people figure out that their opponents' are worse than they thought they were!)
Each of the following steps to improve communication can be used singly or in combination.</p>

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/fixstereo.htm">Breakdown Stereotypes </a></strong></h3>

<p>One of the most important communication techniques is also one of the simplest. The
parties need to recognize that the stereotypes that they have about their opponents (and
allies) are likely to be inaccurate, and that a failure to correct these inaccuracies can
easily lead to bad decisions. This recognition then provides the parties with the
motivation that they need to pursue more effective means of communication. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/opencomm.htm">Opening Lines of Communication </a></strong></h3>

<p>Successful communication requires that the parties have a way of contacting one another
which they feel comfortable using. This means that they should know what to do if they
want to pass a message to other parties and that the other parties will carefully attend
to the messages that they receive. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: Neglected Opportunities for

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/mtdiplom.htm">Unofficial Channels / Multitrack Diplomacy </a></strong></h3>

<p>In cases where official diplomats and formal representatives of the parties are

representatives may provide a workable alternative. Originally formulated as &quot;track
two diplomacy&quot; to be differentiated, but supportive of official or &quot;track
one&quot; diplomacy, John McDonald and Louise Diamond suggested that there are actually
nine tracks that all mutually reinforce each other in a peacebuilding system.<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/dialog2.htm">Dialogue Projects </a></strong></h3>

<p>In many cases, the parties may be unwilling to participate in a negotiation process
because of they don't want to have to compromise their deeply-held values. Nevertheless,
they may be willing to participate in a dialogue process where the objective is for the
parties to better understand each another and establish a positive relationship with each
other without being pressured to change their own views in any way. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link:

<p>Active listening is designed to overcome poor listening practices by requiring parties

expressed as well as the substance. The purpose is to confirm that the listener accurately
understands the message sent and acknowledges that message (<strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="although the listener

<p>Dialogic listening is similar to active listening, although it emphasizes conversation
as a shared activity and stresses an open-ended, playful attitude toward the conversation.
In addition, the parties focus on what is happening between them, (rather than each party
focusing on what is going on within the mind of the other) and it focuses on the present
more than on the past or the future. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: Failure to understand

<p>When hostility between parties reaches the point where they refuse to talk to each

shuttles back and forth between opposing sides carrying messages. In some cases these
third parties may go beyond simple communication and assume the role of a mediator. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem

<p>When new people enter a negotiation or become leaders of a group involved in an ongoing
conflict, it is essential that they be fully briefed about the history of the conflict and
conflict management processes. Although it is inevitable that the new people will not see
things exactly the same way as the people they replace, less disruption of the conflict
management process will occur if the new people at least enter the process understanding

unthinkable had the stereotype been true. Sometimes called &quot;disarming&quot; moves
(though they have nothing to do with military disarmament), these are actions that are
surprisingly reasonable. They help break down negative stereotypes as they prove that the
enemy is actually reasonable and likable. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: Inaccurate Stereotypes;

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/de-esc.htm">De-escalation</a></strong></h3>

a number of techniques are available, and are described below. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Problem Link:

<p>Parties often do not understand the threats posed by escalation, so they fail to take
simple steps which can significantly reduce this threat. They also escalate conflicts
intentionally, without recognizing the problems this can cause. By simply understanding
the costs--as well as the benefits--of escalation, disputants can make better decisions
about when and how to escalate a conflict, and when de-escalation is a better approach. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/cooloff.htm">Cooling-Off Periods </a></strong></h3>

<p>In crisis situations angry people are often under great pressure to make instantaneous
decisions of great importance. Under such circumstances people commonly act in overly
confrontational ways which they later regret. One strategy for limiting this problem is
for the parties to agree to a &quot;cooling-off&quot; period, during which everyone can
re- evaluate the situation and make more carefully reasoned decisions. A related strategy
involves the restructuring of forces (usually military) in ways which make instantaneous
responses impossible. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: Escalation; Crisis. Example Link: INSERT" --> </strong><em>For more

<p>It is helpful to be careful about the way one speaks to opponents and to the public at

<p>De-escalation is much more difficult to implement than is escalation. One strategy for
starting a de-escalation spiral is what Charles Osgood called GRIT--graduated reciprocal
reductions in tension. This involves one side making a small conciliatory gesture, which
they hope is matched by a conciliatory response. If it is not, a second or third small
gesture can be made to indicate one's interest and willingness to de-escalate the
conflict. Once the opponent reciprocates, another slightly more important conciliatory
step can be taken, and if that is matched, the pattern can be continued, resulting in a
cycle of conciliation in place of the former cycle of escalation. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link:

situation they are likely to let their personal issues interfere with their ability to
pursue the group's goals. More progress toward group goals can often be made by appointing

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/angermgt.htm">Dealing with Anger </a></strong></h3>

<p>Interactions involving parties who are extremely angry with each often degenerate into
emotional confrontations which increase, rather than decrease, hostilities. Effective
anger management strategies are needed to help people deal with their anger without
further escalating the conflict. Anger management must include efforts to deal with the
underlying causes of that anger--which usually relate to, but are not always the same as,
the core conflict issues. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: Escalation; Anger; Emotions. Example

<h3><a href="treatment/pkeeping.htm"><strong>Peacekeepers (see peacekeeping)</strong></a></h3>

<p>In situations involving the risk of direct physical confrontation, it can be very
useful to place peacekeepers between the parties so that violent confrontation are
impossible without placing the peacekeepers at risk. To be effective, peacekeepers need to
represent groups which neither side is willing to endanger. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link:

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/observr.htm">Observers (also see peacekeeping)</a></strong></h3>

<p>In hostile confrontations, disputants are often tempted to do things to harm or
terrorize an opponent that would be widely condemned by the larger society or the world as
a whole. In these situations, violence can often be limited when observers, who are
trusted by the larger community, constantly accompany vulnerable individuals. The purpose
of such &quot;protective accompanyment&quot; is to report aggressive behavior and human
rights violations to the larger community and the world as a whole, where condemnation
would be assured. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: violence; war crimes; human rights abuses (during

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/goodspc.htm">Censorship of Hate Speech</a></strong></h3>

<p>Although democracies usually support the concept of freedom of speech, an argument can
be made that hate speech should be censored to prevent conflict escalation and limit
dehumanization.<strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Problem Link: Hate speech; dehumanization; intentional

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/goodspc.htm">Answering Hate Speech with Good Speech</a></strong></h3>

<p>An alternative to censorship is to respond to hate speech with &quot;good speech&quot;
speech that takes the moral &quot;high ground&quot; and tries to defuse the situation,
acknowledging the speakers' strong feelings without agreeing with them or striking back.

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/mediamg2.htm">Media Management</a></strong></h3>

<p>The media will often escalate a conflict by emphasizing the extreme people and events.
By educating the media about more responsible and constructive ways of reporting about a
conflict, and particular events within that conflict, the media can play a much more
constructive role in constructive confrontation. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: Escalation;

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/conclvic.htm">Conciliatory Victory </a></strong></h3>

<p>The victorious party can reduce the intensity and likelihood of future disputes by
responding with conciliatory gestures rather than gloating behavior. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/istate.htm">&quot;I&quot; Statements not &quot;You&quot;
Statements </a></strong></h3>

<p>Simply changing the way in which complaints are phrased can limit escalation pressures.
For example accusatory phrases, &quot;you did this,&quot; are often more likely to
contribute to escalation than less accusatory phrases such as &quot;I am having trouble
because of this.&quot; <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link:Escalation. Example Link:" --> <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="6814." --> </strong><em>For more information about this approach

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/futurfcs.htm">Future Focus </a></strong></h3>

<p>Escalation can be limited by helping the parties focus on the future relationship that
they would like to build between one another, and not the assignment of blame and
punishment for past misdeeds. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: Escalation. Example Link: INSERT " --></strong><em>For more
