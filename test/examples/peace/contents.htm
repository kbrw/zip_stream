<h2>What is this Conflict About</h2>

<h3>Framing: What Are Your Goals?</h3>

<p>{OLD TITLE: Framing: What is this conflict about?} The first part of a conflict
assessment is to define what the conflict is about from one's own point of view. What are
the key issues? What is your position with respect to those issues? In other words, what
are you asking for? Conflict professionals often refer to the process of defining what a
conflict is about as &quot;framing.&quot; The term &quot;framing&quot; is a metaphor for
the process of framing a picture or looking out a window frame. When two people look out a
window, their eyes take in the same scene. However, their brains may interpret what they
see very differently. One person may focus on the people walking below; another may focus
on the traffic in the street; a third on the weather. Each person describes or
&quot;frames&quot; the scene differently. Similarly, two people viewing a conflict may
frame the conflict differently. One may see the key issue as jobs, while another may
define it in terms of environmental quality, or quality of life. Being clear about one's
goals, what one is trying to obtain from the conflict, and why that is so important is
critical to success. : <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="&lt;!--Example links 6280--&gt;" --></p>

<h3>Scoping: Who are the other parties involved and what do they think the conflict is
about?</h3>

<p>After assessing one's own view of the conflict, it is important to consider who else is
involved and what their view of the conflict is. We call this part of the conflict
assessment &quot;scoping.&quot; </p>

<p>Who else is involved?</p>

<p>Conflict professionals often refer to the people involved in a conflict as disputants,
or parties. In order to deal with a conflict effectively, all the parties to the conflict
must be identified. Often these individuals or groups are divided into categories.
&quot;First parties&quot; are the disputants who initiated the conflict--they are the ones
who are seeking a change. In legal terms, they are the &quot;plaintiff.&quot; &quot;Second
parties&quot; are the ones who oppose the first parties. Usually, they oppose the first
party's change--they want to maintain the status quo. Lawyers refer to these parties as
&quot;defendants.&quot; </p>

<p>Other parties may be involved in or are affected by the conflict, even though they have
not taken a side. These people are often called &quot;third parties.&quot; Sometimes the
term &quot;third party&quot; is reserved for people who become actively involved in trying
to help the disputants to resolve the conflict. Mediators, arbitrators, conciliators, or
judges, for example, are usually referred to as &quot;third parties.&quot; In other cases,
the term &quot;third party&quot; simply refers to people who are affected by the conflict,
but who have not become involved on one side or the other.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
How do the other parties define, or frame the conflict?</p>

<p>Often, different parties will describe or &quot;frame&quot; a conflict very
differently. Continuing the window metaphor, an adult may look out a window, see a heavy
snowstorm and react with dread, while a child may look at the same scene with delight. The
adult and the child frame the scene differently because their interests and needs are
different. Similarly, people who are in different situations will have different interests
and needs, so they too will frame a conflict situation differently from each other. </p>

<h2><br WP="BR1">
What factors are complicating the conflict? Complicating Factors</h2>

<p>The second step in any conflict assessment is to identify all the other people involved
in the conflict, and to identify, as much as possible, how each of them views the
conflict. This requires determining the other parties' positions, interests, and needs.
This process is even more prone to error, as communication and understanding between
conflicting parties is usually poor, and parties may not even agree within themselves what
their positions, interests and needs are. In addition to communication problems (which are
discussed elsewhere), common scoping problems are:</p>

<p>finding problems, decision making procedural problems, and escalation. These
complicating factors tend to intensify or obscure the core conflict, making it harder to
deal with effectively. Even when the core conflict is highly resistant to resolution, by
limiting (or even eliminating) most of the complicating factors, it is possible to deal
with the remaining conflict in a much more constructive way. </p>

<p>The following sections deal with the four most common kinds of complicating factors: 

<ul>
  <li>Communication Problems. *LINK* Failure of the parties to effectively communicate with
    each another.</ins></li>
  <li><ins>Fact-Finding Problems. *LINK* Failure of the parties to determine or agree upon the
    facts related to a conflict.</li>
  <li>Procedural Problems. *LINK* Failure of dispute resolution processes to meet prevailing
    standards of fairness.</li>
  <li><ins>Escalation Problems. *LINK* Failure of the parties to control dynamics which
    unnecessarily intensify the conflict.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Communication Problems</h3>

<p>Effective communication is essential to all conflict management processes. Ironically,
communication is perhaps the first things to be harmed when a conflict develops. Parties
tend to close down communication entirely, or speak in anger, saying things that they do
not really mean. Often the communication that takes place escalates the conflict and does
more harm than good. Below is a list of common communication problems, linked to a list of
strategies for limiting or avoiding these problems.<ins></ins>

    escalation.</ins></li>
</ul>

<h3>Fact-finding* HB other intro?*</h3>

<p>In many cases, the parties may disagree about the key facts surrounding a conflict. For
example, one party might believe that a chemical plant is operating safely, while
opponents believe that neighbors are being slowly poisoned. Other examples might involve
disagreements over the amount of available irrigation water, the acres of farmland that
both sides would get as part of a peace settlement, or the number of refugees awaiting
re-settlement. Many of these factual disagreements can be resolved through some type of
joint fact-finding process. Other factual disagreements, however, contain irreducible
uncertainties which make such resolution impossible. </p>

<h3><a NAME="_1_86"></a>Procedural Problems</h3>

<p>Democratic societies typically resolve public disputes using some type of governmental
process in which decisions are made by the courts, legislative bodies, or the electorate.
While citizens do not expect to win every dispute, they do expect to be treated fairly. If
they believe they are being treated unfairly, they are likely to actively oppose the
decision-making process and the decision that is made. Key to avoiding these problems is
having a clear understanding of the basic principles of fairness and being sure that all
decision making processes carefully adhere to those principles. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="&lt;!--General Example Link:6584. --&gt;" -->

    fair. </ins></li>

    fairness of decision making and dispute resolution processes</ins>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Escalation</h3>

<p>Escalation can dramatically increase the level of hostility far beyond what would be
justified by the core issues. Escalation occurs when one party responds to an intentional
or unintentional provocation with an even greater counter provocation. This in turn leads
to a further counter-counter provocation in an endless cycle which dramatically
intensifies the conflict. This is especially likely to happen when personal attacks,
violence, or polarization are involved. Despite its costs, escalation is often viewed by
disputants as desirable because it focuses attention on the importance of an issue and
helps parties mobilize supporters. <ins></ins>

Strategies for Confronting the Core Issues in Conflict</h2>

<p>In the introduction, we differentiated between two parts of a conflict: the core
conflict and the complicating factors. The core conflict involves the basic things that
the conflict is about --the incompatible interests, the unmet needs, the fundamental value
differences, or the struggle for justice. Although conflicts can be about almost anything,
conflicts that most commonly seem to resist resolution are often focused on particular
types of problems. These include:</p>

<h3><br WP="BR1">
Nature of the Core Conflict<br WP="BR2">
</h3>
<strong>

<h3><a HREF="problem/coreissues.htm">Types of Core Issues</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li><a HREF="problem/denyid.htm">The Denial of Identity</a></li>
  <li><strong><a HREF="problem/needs.htm">The Denial of Other Human Needs</a></strong></li>
  <li><strong><a HREF="problem/dominatn.htm">Domination Conflicts</a></strong></li>
  <li><strong><a HREF="problem/histake.htm">High Stakes Distributional Conflicts</a></strong></li>
</ul>
</strong>

<p><strong>The Denial of Identity</strong> - Conflicts often arise between racial, ethnic,
or other groups when one group denies the legitimacy or equal status of another
group.&lt;!-- Example Links: 6320, 6811, 5746, 1975, 5338, 1249--&gt;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Denial of Other Human Needs</strong> - In addition to identity, people also
have fundamental needs for security and recognition. When these needs are not fulfilled,
the group being threatened will usually do everything in their power to remedy the
situation. Unlike conflicts of interest, which can often be negotiated, human needs are
not compromisable. Thus needs conflicts tend to be protracted. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="&lt;!--Example Links: 7033, 7270 --&gt; ." --></p>

<p><strong>Deep-rooted Value Differences</strong> - Many resolution-resistant conflicts
involve disputes about fundamental values--beliefs regarding what is right and what is
wrong. Often these are religious conflicts, but they can revolve around secular values as
well. For example, some people place a very high value on the protection of the
environment and endangered species, even when doing so harms human welfare. Others think
human welfare is far more important. Conflicts over value differences such as these are
very hard to resolve.</p>

<p><strong>Domination conflicts</strong></p>

<p>Similar to identity conflicts, domination conflicts are conflicts that develop when one
person or group tries to dominate another.<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="&lt;!-- Example Links: 6320, 6811.--&gt; " -->

<dl>
  <dt><strong>High Stakes Distributional Conflicts</strong></dt>
  <dt>although conflicts over interests are often easier to negotiate than conflicts over
    values or needs, when the stakes are very high, and a win-win outcome is impossible,
    conflicts tend to be intractable. </dt>
</dl>

<p>People involved in such conflicts can do one of two things. They can withdraw from the
conflict, or they can confront it in some way. (For a short discussion about withdrawing
from a conflict, see 7274).* When people confront a conflict, they are trying to influence
the situation in a way which will benefit themselves. They may do so in a variety of
ways--they may use force, they may try to negotiate, or they may try to persuade the
opponent to change his or her attitudes and/or behavior through emotional or rational
appeals. Often people or groups try a combination of several strategies in an effort to
prevail. Their success is determined by a number of things: their sources and amount of
power; their opponents' sources and amount of power, and their ability to utilize power
wisely.</p>

<p>The following section describes how power can be used and abused to confront
resolution-resistant conflicts. *First we discuss the use of force and examine the
problems that often develop when force-based strategies are used. In the linked
&quot;solutions&quot; sections we consider how these problems can be avoided and how force
can be used as an effective confrontational strategy. We then discuss persuasive or
integrative* strategies--strategies for bonding groups together and using persuasion to
convince people to respect each others' interests and needs. This also is presented in a
problem-solution format. Third, we look at negotiation opportunities and examine problems
and solutions that are available to determine when negotiation will work and how it should
be accomplished. Lastly, we look at combination strategies-approaches to conflicts that
use a combination of force, negotiation, and/or persuasion to pursue a party's goals.</p>

<h2>Force</h2>

<p>Parties often attempt to use force-based strategies to advance their interests. In
simple terms force-based power takes the following form: &quot;you do what I want you to
do, or I will do something that you do not want me to do.&quot; Thus, parties attempt to
force their opponents to submit by threatening to impose unacceptable sanctions if they do
not. </p>

<p>Many different type of force are available and each has its own advantages and
disadvantages. Some types of force involve efforts to obtain government (and police)
support through legal or political processes. Other types of force involve violent threats
leveled by military or paramilitary units or by individuals. Still other types of force
involve economic activities (e.g. strikes and boycotts) or non-violent demonstrations and
protests.

</ul>

<h2>Integrative Power</h2>

<p>Integrative power encourages people to do the right thing because they want to, not
because they are being forced or paid to do it. In some cases, integrative power arises
from successful efforts to persuade people to change their behavior. In other cases change
can result from an individual's own moral decisions or from their decision to follow the
examples set by others. Integrative power can be very effective--often more effective than
force. However, it must be pursued correctly and in the appropriate circumstances. When it
is used incorrectly, it can be ineffective, or even harmful. Problems relating to the use
of integrative power are found below.

</ul>

<h2><ins>Trading Power (Negotiation)</h2>

<p>Disputants can also advance their positions through exchange or negotiation. In some
cases, these exchanges may truly be win-win. The disputants may redefine the conflict,
allowing a solution to be developed which was not recognized before, or the disputants may
be able to reach a limited win-win agreement on some aspects of the conflict, while other
issues remain unresolved. </p>

<p>Often, however, negotiated agreements require significant compromises and sacrifices.
If the parties have reached a stalemate and see no way to do better with continued
conflict, the negotiation of a solution is sometimes the best choice. In other cases,
negotiation is done at the end of a power contest when one side has clearly won. In this
case the parties use negotiation to define the terms of surrender.
