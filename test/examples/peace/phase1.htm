<h1 align="center"><strong>Brief Review of Phase I of the </strong></h1>

<h1 ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>International Online Training Program</strong></h1>

<hr>

<p>The first phase of the International Online Training Program, funded by the U.S.
Institute of Peace and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, is now nearing completion
The project was designed to take advantage of the enormous improvement in information
access being provided by the Internet and the World Wide Web. While high speed
communication has been available to top-level businessmen and diplomats for some time, the
web brings this capability to many more people. While it is still a long way from being
accessible to everyone, an amazing number of people in even the poorest countries are
gaining access to the Net. In Phase I of our project, our goal was to use the Internet to
provide access to as much of the conflict knowledge base as possible, especially as it
relates to finding better ways of dealing with destructive, intractable conflicts. </p>

<p>Phase I was based upon the following assumptions:

<ul>
  <li>Unconventional, &quot;Grassroots&quot; Diplomats Play a Crucial Role in Peace Building
    and Conflict Transformation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Although formal negotiations still take place between official diplomats, more
and more conflict transformation is occurring between ordinary citizens-religious leaders,
conflict resolution professionals, advocates working on behalf of interest groups or
political groups, people with humanitarian relief organizations, non-governmental
peacemaking teams, other NGOs, commercial interests, scholars, and even tourists.
Sometimes these people intend to become involved in peace building or conflict resolution
activities; at other times they get drawn into it rather accidentally. Or, they may get
drawn into the conflicts themselves and need conflict management or resolution skills to
know how to best deal with the unexpected situation. Our system is designed to provide
information to these individuals. </p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> <strong>Part-Time, Do-It-Yourselfers</strong></p>

<p>Professional conflict intervention is expensive, so only a tiny percentage of conflicts
can be mediated by conflict professionals. Most interactions are handled, rather, by
either the parties themselves, or by informal intermediaries, neither of whom are likely
to be skilled in the latest conflict management techniques. In the absence of such
training, these &quot;do-it-yourselfers&quot; use common sense approaches, which often
lack both scientific knowledge about conflict processes and practical experience of those
who have struggled with similar conflicts in the past. </p>

<p>Most of these do-it-yourselfers are also &quot;part-timers&quot; with many other
pressing demands on their time. This means that any training program must be extremely
efficient or people won't have time to use it. Further, effective training must be
precisely focused on the user's immediate problems--part-time do-it-yourselfers don't have
time to learn how to deal with somebody else's problems. They usually don't have much
money to spend either. Typical training programs are likely to be completely out of reach
to most parties.</p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> <strong>Windows of Opportunity</strong></p>

<p>Effective dissemination programs must also be able to work within a narrow &quot;window
of opportunity.&quot; There is usually a brief period between the time that someone is
presented with a conflict problem and the time when they must commit to a particular
course of action. If better options can be provided during this critical window, they are
likely to take them. They are also likely to return to this resource in the future as
additional conflict problems arise. This, in turn, is likely to lead to long-term
improvements in their overall conflict skills. </p>

<p>If such information is not forthcoming, however, the parties can be expected to stick
with often destructive, &quot;business-as-usual&quot; practices. In short, information
provided outside of this window is likely to be of limited utility. A major focus of the
Consortium program has, therefore, been the creation of a program that works within narrow
time constraints<strong>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Strategies for Overcoming Dissemination Limits</strong></p>

<p>Overcoming current limits on information dissemination will require either 1) enormous
increases in the field's overall funding level, or 2) significant increases in the
efficiency of dissemination programs. We believe that the most promising, currently
available approach involves using the Internet to increase efficiency and provide large
numbers of people with information that is:</p>

<p>virtually free (for those with access to the net),</p>

<p>instantly available,</p>

<p>easy to access,</p>

<p>largely complete (full-text online information can eliminate the need for an often
futile search for print publications),</p>

<p>customized to the specific needs of individual users, and </p>

<p>sensitive to user differences in languages, culture, socio-economic, and political
contexts</p>

<p>Our online training program is designed to pursue this opportunity.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced, Internet-Based Distance Learning</strong></p>

<p>The Consortium program can be used in a large variety of ways. It will be available as
a complete for-credit university course (through the Department of Continuing Education at
the University of Colorado), or as a free course for independent study. It will also be
usable as an online consulting service capable of providing specific answers to a specific
conflict questions. </p>

<p>The program is structured so that users can find as little or as much information as
they want about a wide variety of topics. They can read the introductory theoretical
material on conflict processes and conflict resolution (as they must if they are taking
the course), or they can skip this material and go directly to the more practical
problem-solution section. They can do the exercises and the assignments on their own, with
others, for credit or not. In short, users can take as much or as little of this program
as they want. Most is available for free, and even course credit is relatively
inexpensive. During the initial phase of evaluation and testing, users can obtain most of
the benefits of taking the course for credit (such as instructor feedback on assignments
and answers to questions) in exchange for giving us their critique of the materials. The
only thing we cannot give for free is formal University credit.</p>

<p><strong>Material Organization</strong></p>

<p>The bulk of the material provided in this program is organized in problem and solution
lists. These lists are organized in a way that is consistent with on our theory of
intractable conflicts (which is described in Appendix 1). Though based on theory, the
lists provide very practical descriptions of what tends to go wrong in intractable
conflicts, and what approaches are available for dealing with each of these problems.
(Multiple approaches are given for each problem, since different contexts call for
different types of solutions.) </p>

<p>Short descriptions of all the problems and solutions are provided for users who want a
quick overview; these are linked to longer descriptions for users who want more
information. The longer descriptions are then linked to real-world examples of the problem
or accounts of solution as they have really been implemented. These are generally drawn
from outside books and articles-not just our own experience. A concerted effort has been
made to find examples from outside the U.S., although some U.S. examples are provided too
(in part to acknowledge that the U.S., too, has serious conflict problems, and in part
because we expect users to be from the U.S. as well as abroad).</p>

<p>The benefits of this approach, we feel, are several. The system provides access to a
vast amount of information about conflict and conflict resolution processes, far more than
is likely to be found in a few textbooks. It also is customizable-it is easy to find
information on exactly what the reader needs, without having to wade through a lot of
unwanted information. </p>

<p>Yet the information is all expandable. Since books are often hard to obtain in the
third world, we have provided summaries to key books as much as possible, and have tried
to provide links to other on-line sources of information where they exist. We have also
provided traditional citations for books and articles and links to online sources (such as
amazon.com) for purchasing these items. (Options for purchasing articles are,
unfortunately, much more expensive.) For this reason, we have summarized as many of the
useful articles as we could on the web site. (This is an area we wish to expand
substantially in Phase II.) Also, unlike books, the project also provides participants
with connections to the larger community of people who are interested in the field.</p>

<p>The basic training program, with its online modules, assignments, and exercises is
roughly equivalent in scope to a three-hour, upper division university course. By using
the course's optional additional reference materials, exercises, and assignments, the
scope of the program could be expanded considerably. This allows the program to provide
far more information than is available in a standard 40 hour, one-week training program.
More specific information about the contents of the program is found in Appendices 2-5</p>
