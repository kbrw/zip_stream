  <dt><a href="treatment/activel.htm"><b>Active Listening</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Active listening is a way of listening that focuses entirely on what the other person is
    saying and confirms understanding of both the content of the message and the emotions and
    feelings underlying the message to ensure that understanding is accurate.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Adversarial Approach</strong></dt>
  <dd>The adversarial approach to a conflict sees the other party or parties as an enemy to be
    defeated. It can be compared to the problem-solving approach which views the other party
    or parties as people who have a common problem that needs to be jointly solved. The
    adversarial approach typically leads to competitive confrontation strategies, while the
    problem-solving approach leads to cooperative or integrative strategies for approaching
    the conflict situation.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Adversary/Adversaries</strong></dt>
  <dd>Adversaries are people who oppose each other in a conflict. They are also called
    opponents, parties, or disputants.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><b><a href="treatment/adavr.htm">Advocacy</a> </b></dt>
  <dd>Advocacy is the process of taking and working for a particular side<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE="2">=</font>s interests in a conflict. Lawyers engage in
    advocacy when they represent a client in a legal proceeding. Disputants can also engage in
    advocacy themselves--arguing for their own position in negotiation, mediation, or a
    political debate. Any attempt to persuade another side to agree to your demands is
    advocacy.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a href="treatment/amnesty.htm"><strong>Amnesty</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>The granting of a pardon for past offenses--especially political offenses--including,
    for example, human rights violations and war crimes.</dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><a href="treatment/anps.htm"><b>Analytical Problem Solving</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This is an approach to deep-rooted or intractable conflicts that brings disputants
    together to analyze the underlying human needs that cause their conflict, and then helping
    them work together to develop ways to provide the necessary needs to resolve the problem. </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="treatment/arbitrat.htm"><b>Arbitration</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Arbitration is a method of resolving a dispute in which the disputants present their
    case to an impartial third party, who then makes a decision for them which resolves the
    conflict. This decision is usually binding. Arbitration differs from mediation in which
    third party simply helps the disputants develop a solution on their own.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a href="problem/counthrt.htm"><strong>Arms Race</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>An arms race occurs whenever two adversaries race each other to make sure that each has
    at least as many armaments as the other. This typically leads to an escalation spiral with
    each side building and/or acquiring more and more weapons in an effort to stay ahead of
    the enemy.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><strong><a href="problem/batna.htm">ATNA</a></strong> </dt>
  <dd>This is a variation of Fisher and Ury's concept of BATNA--which stands for best
    alternative to a negotiated agreement.&nbsp; We use &quot;ATNA&quot; to refer to any
    alternative to a negotiated agreement, not just the best one.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a href="problem/illegit_force.htm"><b>Backlash</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Backlash is a negative response to an action. When someone or a group is forced to do
    something against their will they will often resist or try to get back at the person or
    group who forced them in the first place. This can result in a reversal of an apparently
    resolved situation, and may even escalate the conflict further. </dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a href="problem/batna.htm"><b>BATNA</b></a></dt>
  <dd>BATNA is a term invented by Roger Fisher and William Ury which stands for &quot;best
    alternative to a negotiated agreement.&quot; Any negotiator should determine his or her
    BATNA before agreeing to any negotiated settlement. If the settlement is as good as or
    better than one's BATNA, the agreement should be accepted. If the alternative is better,
    it should be pursued instead of the negotiated settlement. When one party's BATNA is good
    (or even if they just think it is good), they are unlikely to be willing to enter into
    negotiations, preferring instead to pursue their alternative option.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a href="treatment/citdip.htm"><b>Citizen Diplomacy</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Citizen diplomacy (sometimes called &quot;track two diplomacy&quot;) refers to
    unofficial contacts between people of different nations, as differentiated from official
    contacts between governmental representatives. Citizen diplomacy includes exchanges of
    people (such as student exchanges), international religious, scientific and cultural
    activities, as well as unofficial dialogues, discussions, or negotiations between citizens
    of opposing nations.</dd>

  <dt></font><font size="3"><a href="treatment/comgrd.htm">Common Ground/</a>Commonalties</dt>
  </b>
  <dd>Common ground or commonalties refers to the things two people or groups share, or hold
    in common. These may include living in the same place, having similar values, interests,
    or needs, or even similar experiences or fears. Although disputants often assume they have
    nothing in common with their opponents, they almost always have some common ground--even
    if it is only a common desire to live in peace and security without having to fear the
    other.</font><font SIZE="2"></dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt></font><font size="3"><strong>Communication Channels </strong></dt>
  <dd>Communication channels are the means available to communicate with another person or
    group. They may include direct face-to-face communication, telecommunications (telephone,
    e-mail, written communications), or indirect communication--through third parties or the
    media, for example.</font><font SIZE="2"></dd>

  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><b>Community Organizing</b></dt>
  <b>
  <dd></b>Community organizing is a process through which an expert helps a group of
    individuals engage in collective action to address a social problem. Community organizers
    help people work together to get what they want or need: they may help people work
    together to get more jobs in a community; they may help people fight an unfair government
    law or ruling; or they may help people work together to force a polluter to clean up their
    industrial process so it no longer pollutes the environment as badly.<b></dd>

  <dt></font><font size="3"><a href="problem/complicate.htm"><strong>Complicating Factors</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Conflict complicating factors are dynamics such as communication problems or escalation
    which, while common, are usually extraneous parts of the conflict which confuse the core
    issues in the conflict and make them more difficult to understand and deal with. </font><font SIZE="2"></dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt></font><font size="3"><strong>Compromise</strong></dt>
  <dd>A solution to a mutual problem that meets some, but not all, of each of the parties'
    interests. </font><font SIZE="2"></dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt></font><font size="3"><strong>Concessions</strong></dt>
  <dd>Concessions are things one side gives up to try to de-escalate or resolve a conflict.
    They may simply be points in an argument, a reduction in demands, or a softening of one
    side's position.</font><font SIZE="2"></dd>
  </font>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><b>Conciliation</b></dt>
  <dd>Conciliation involves efforts by a third party to improve the relationship between two
    or more disputants. It may be done as a part of mediation, or independently. Generally,
    the third party will work with the disputants to correct misunderstandings, reduce fear
    and distrust, and generally improve communication between the parties in conflict.
    Sometimes this alone will result in dispute settlement; at other times, it paves the way
    for a later mediation process.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><strong>Conflict Management</strong></dt>
  <dd><font size="3">This term refers to the long-term management of intractable conflicts and
    the people involved in them so that they do not escalate out of control and become
    violent.</font></dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><strong>Conflict Resolution</strong></dt>
  <dd>This term (along with dispute resolution) usually refers to the process of resolving a
    dispute or a conflict permanently, by providing each sides' needs, and adequately
    addressing their interests so that they are satisfied with the outcome.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a href="treatment/contrns.htm"><b>Conflict Transformation</b></a></dt>
  <font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
  <dd></font><font size="3">This term is being used more and more to refer to a change
    (usually an improvement) in the nature of a conflict--a de-escalation or a reconciliation
    between people or groups. Unlike conflict resolution, which denies the long-term nature of
    conflict, or conflict management, which assumes that people and relationships can be
    managed as though they were physical objects, the concept of conflict transformation
    reflects the notion that conflicts go on for long periods of time, changing the nature of
    the relationships between the people involved, and themselves changing as people's
    response to the situation develops over time.</font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"></dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  </font>
  <dt><font size="3"><b>Conflicts of Interest </b></font></dt>
  <font size="3">
  <dd>This term refers to the situation in which a person has a vested interest in the outcome
    of a decision, but tries to influence the decision making process as if they did not. In
    other words, they stand to benefit from a decision if it goes a particular way, but they
    participate in the decision making process as if they were neutral. An example would be an
    expert from the tobacco industry testifying that tobacco is safe and does not cause
    cancer. If he argued this on the basis of scientific merits, rather than his connection to
    the tobacco industry, he could be charged with having a conflict of interest which altered
    his position on tobacco research.</dd>

  <dt></font><font size="3">&nbsp;</dt>
  </font>
  <dt><a href="treatment/consenpr.htm"><b><font size="3">Consensus</font></b></a></dt>
  <font SIZE="2">
  <dd></font><font size="3">Consensus decision making requires that everyone agrees with a
    decision; not just a majority as occurs in majority-rule processes. In consensus-based
    processes, people must work together to develop an agreement that is good enough (though
    not necessarily perfect) that all of the people at the table are willing to agree to it. </dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><b>Constituents/Constituency</b></dt>
  <dd>Constituents or one's constituency refers to the people a decision maker represents. The
    constituents of a governmental leader are the citizens he or she represents in Parliament
    or other legislative body. The constituents of a negotiator are the people he or she is
    negotiating for; members of a union, perhaps, or of an interest group or business. </font><font SIZE="2"></dd>
  </font>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a href="treatment/constcon.htm"><strong>Constructive Conflict/Confrontation</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>We use the term &quot;constructive&quot; to refer to a conflict which has more benefits
    than costs--one that pulls people together, strengthens and/or improves their relationship
    (by redefining it in a more appropriate or useful way) and one that leads to positive
    change in all of the parties involved. It is contrasted with destructive conflict which
    has largely negative results--pushing people apart, destroying relationships, and leading
    to negative changes including an escalation of violence, fear, and distrust.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><strong>Cooperation/Cooperative Approach</strong></dt>
  <dd>In cooperation, disputants work together to solve a mutual problem. According to Morton
    Deutsch, (Resolution of Conflict, 1973) a cooperative situation is one in which the goals
    of the participants are so linked that any participant can attain his goal if, and only
    if, the others with whom he is linked can attain their goals. It is contrasted with a
    competitive approach in which it is assumed that it is impossible to win, unless the other
    side loses.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a href="problem/coreissues.htm"><strong>Core Issues</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>We distinguish between core issues in a conflict, which are the fundamental interests,
    values, and needs which are in conflict with each other, and complicating factors, which
    are dynamics such as communication problems or escalation which, while common, are usually
    extraneous parts of the conflict which confuse the core issues and make them more
    difficult to understand and deal with.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a href="treatment/costing.htm"><strong>Costing</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Costing is the process of assessing the costs and benefits of a particular action; not
    only in monetary terms, but in terms of time, resources, emotional energy, and other
    intangible effects on people's lives. </dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><b>Credibility</b></dt>
  <font SIZE="2">
  <dd></font><font size="3">Credibility refers to whether or not a person or a statement is
    believed or trusted. Sometimes leaders or expert witnesses are not considered by the
    public to be credible because they have a personal interest in the outcome of a situation
    or a conflict which would likely influence their views and/or statements about that
    situation or conflict.</dd>

  <dt></font><font size="3"><b>Decision making process</b></dt>
  </font>
  <dd><font size="3">The decision making process is the process that is used to make a
    decision. It can be an expert process, where the decision is made by one or more</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>&quot;experts&quot; who look at the &quot;facts&quot; and make the
    decision based on those facts; it can be a political process through which a political
    representative or body makes the decision based on political considerations, or it might
    be a judicial process where a judge or a jury makes a decision based on an examination of<big>
    </big>legal evidence and the law.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a href="treatment/de-esc.htm"><b>De-escalation</b></a></dt>
  <dd>De-escalation is the opposite of escalation. It is the ratcheting down of the intensity
    of a conflict which occurs as parties tire out, or begin to realize that the conflict is
    doing them more harm than good. They then may begin to make concessions, or reduce the
    intensity of their attacks, moving slowly toward an eventual negotiated resolution.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a href="problem/dehuman1.htm"><b>De-humanization</b></a></dt>
  <b>
  <dd></b>This is the psychological process of demonizing the enemy, making them seem less

  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt>Destructive Conflict/Confrontation</dt>
  <font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
  <dd></font></b><font size="3">Destructive conflict and confrontation has largely negative
    results--it pushes people apart, destroys relationships, and leads to a host of negative
    personal and social changes including an escalation of violence, fear, and distrust. It is
    contrasted with constructive conflict and confrontation which has more benefits than
    costs--one that pulls people together, strengthens and/or improves their relationship (by
    redefining it in a more appropriate or useful way) and one that leads to positive change
    in all of the parties involved. </font><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"></dd>

  </b>
  <dt><a href="treatment/dialog2.htm"><b>Dialogue</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Dialogue is a process for sharing and learning about another group's beliefs, feelings,
    interests, and/or needs in a non-adversarial, open way, usually with the help of a third
    party facilitator. Unlike mediation, in which the goal is usually reaching a resolution or
    settlement of a dispute, the goal of dialogue is usually simply improving interpersonal
    understanding and trust.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><b>Dictatorial Process</b><strong> *</strong></dt>
  <b>
  <dd></b>This term refers to authoritarian decision making processes in which one person (or
    a small group of people) make arbitrary decisions, supposedly on behalf of their people,
    but without any meaningful input from the people, nor any institutionalized process for
    reversing the decision if it is disliked by a majority of the people it affects. It is the
    opposite of democratic decision making processes, in which duly elected or appointed
    representatives or decision makers make decisions based on public input on behalf of their
    constituencies. <b></dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a href="treatment/track1.htm">Diplomacy</a></dt>
  <dd></b>Generally, diplomacy refers to the interaction between two or more nation-states.
    Traditionally carried out by government officials, who negotiate treaties, trade policies,
    and other international agreements, the term has been extended to include unofficial
    exchanges of private citizens (such as cultural, scientific, and religious exchanges) as
    well as unofficial (sometimes called &quot;citizen&quot; or &quot;track-two&quot;)
    diplomacy in which private citizens actually try to develop solutions to international
    diplomatic problems.<b></dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a href="treatment/disarmament.htm">Disarming Strategies</a></dt>
  <dd></b>Disarming strategies are actions that are designed to break down or challenge
    negative stereotypes. If one person or group is seen by another as extremely threatening
    and hostile, a gesture of friendship and goodwill is a disarming move, which will alter
    perceptions of the other and can significantly de-escalate the conflict.<b></dd>

  <dd>This is a variation of Fisher and Ury's concept of BATNA--which stands for best
    alternative to a negotiated agreement.&nbsp; We use &quot;EATNA&quot; to refer to one's <em>estimated</em>
    alternative to a negotiated agreement,--meaning what you think you can get, which may be

  <b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
  <dd></font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">Emotions are psychological feelings
    that people have that usually result from--and contribute to--a conflict. Examples are
    anger, shame, fear, distrust, and a sense of powerlessness. If emotions are effectively
    managed, they can become a resource for effective conflict resolution. If they are not
    effectively managed, however, they can intensify a conflict, heightening tensions and
    making the situation more difficult to resolve.</dd>

  <dd></font><font size="3">Empowerment means giving a person or group more power. This may be
    done by the party alone, through education, coalition building, community organizing,
    resource development, or advocacy assistance. It can also be done by a mediator, who can
    work with the lower power person or group to help them represent themselves more
    effectively. Although this approach causes ethical dilemmas (since helping one side more
    than another compromises a mediator</font><big><font SIZE="2">'</font></big><font size="3">s
    impartiality), it is quite commonly done in the problem-solving or </font><big><font SIZE="2">&quot;</font></big><font size="3">settlement- oriented&quot; approach to
    mediation, since this approach works best when the two parties are relatively equal in
    power. Baruch Bush and Joe Folger, however, advocate the empowerment of both parties
    simultaneously through transformative mediation, which seeks to restore disputants'
    &quot;sense of their own value and strength and their own capacity to handle life's
    problems.&quot; This approach avoids the ethical dilemmas of one-sided empowerment, though
    it sacrifices emphasis on achieving a settlement as primary.</font><font SIZE="2"></dd>

  <dt><a href="problem/escalation.htm"><b><font size="3">Escalation</font></b></a></dt>
  <font SIZE="2">
  <dd></font><font size="3">Escalation is an increase in intensity of a conflict. According to
    Dean Pruitt and Jeffery Rubin (1986, 7-8), as a conflict escalates, the disputants change
    from relatively gentle opposition to heavier, more confrontational tactics. The number of
    parties tends to increase, as do the number of issues, and the breadth of the issues (that
    is, issues change from ones which are very specific to more global concerns). Lastly
    disputants change from not only wanting to win themselves, but also wanting to hurt the
    opponent. While conflicts escalate quickly and easily, de-escalation, a diminishing of
    intensity, is often much harder to achieve.</dd>

    consensus-building meetings. The facilitator typically helps the parties set ground rules
    and agendas, enforces both, and helps the participants keep on track and working toward
    their mutual goals. While similar to a mediator, a facilitator usually plays a less active
    role in the deliberations, and often does not see &quot;resolution&quot; as a goal of his

    without having to have a full vote on an issue. Shortened alternative dispute resolution
    procedures such as arbitration or mini-trials can be used to replace costly litigation.
    Even wars can be avoided by measuring relative military strength and then making an
    assessment of which side would be likely to win. If both sides agree (at least
    approximately) on the likely outcome, then a negotiated solution can be worked out which
    is consistent with that outcome, avoiding the high costs of the protracted struggle.</font><font SIZE="2"><b></dd>

    fundamental human needs: the need for identity, security, and/or recognition. In order to
    resolve such conflicts, ways must be found to provide these needs for all individuals and

    and each of four agencies (the police, the schools, the hospital, and the roads

    opponent to change its policies. While not violent initially, nonviolent direct action can
    provoke a violent response. Thus, forcing someone to do something at gunpoint would not be
    nonviolent direct action, but if demonstrators are forced to retreat by police using or

    understanding-improving process that the negotiators have experienced. We refer to this as
    the &quot;scale-up problem,&quot; as the small group understandings and trust must be
    &quot;scaled up&quot; to the larger population if peace building is to be effective.<b></dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a href="problem/scoping.htm">Scoping</a> *</dt>
  </b>
  <dd>Scoping is the process of determining who else is involved in a conflict and what their
    interests, needs, and positions are. It also involves the determination of external
    constraints that affect the situation and any other factors that define the conflict
    situation beyond one's own view of the conflict.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><strong>Social context</strong></dt>
  <dd>The term &quot;social context&quot;<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE="2"> </font>refers
    to the social relationships the exist in a community at the time the conflict occurs. For
    instance, is one group socially and/or economically dominant, while other groups are less
    successful or discriminated against? </dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><strong>Soft Bargaining</strong></dt>
  <dd>This is a term used to refer to very cooperative, conciliatory bargaining that focuses
    primarily on reaching an agreement and not making the other side upset. Fisher and Ury
    contrast it with adversarial, competitive bargaining that assumes that the opponent is an
    enemy to be defeated, rather than a partner to be worked with cooperatively. They contrast
    both these approaches with a third approach, principled negotiation, which is neither hard
    nor soft, but rather integrative in its approach.</dd>

  <dt><a href="treatment/speace.htm">Stable Peace</a></dt>
  </b>
  <dd>Stable peace is the situation in which two countries do not even consider war to be an
    acceptable or possible option for dispute resolution between them. It is contrasted with
    unstable peace (in which countries are at peace but think that war is possible at a future
    time).</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><b>Stakeholders </b></dt>
  <dd>Stakeholders are people who will be affected by a conflict or the resolution of that
    conflict. It includes current disputants, and also people who are not currently involved
    in the conflict but might become involved because they are likely to be affected by the
    conflict or its outcome sometime in the future.</dd>

  </font><b><font SIZE="2">
  <dd></font></b><font size="3">Stereotyping is the process of assuming a person or group has
    one or more characteristics because most members of that group have (or are thought to
    have) the same characteristics. It is a simplification and generalization process that
    helps people categorize and understand their world, but at the same time it often leads to
    errors. Examples of stereotypes that are often wrong are that women are weak and
    submissive, while men are powerful and domineering. This may be true for some women and
    some men, but it is not true for all. When stereotypes are inaccurate and negative (as
    they often are between groups in conflict) they lead to misunderstandings which make
    resolving the conflict more difficult. </dd>

    This third party can be a neutral outsider, or he or she may be a person already involved
    in the conflict (an insider) who takes on the role of a mediator to help work out a

  <dt><b>Triggering Events</b></dt>
  <b>

    the assassination of Arch Duke Ferdinand was supposedly the &quot;triggering event&quot;
    that started World War I.</dd>

  <dt><a href="problem/valdiff.htm"><b>Value Differences</b></a></dt>
  <b>
  <dd></b>Value differences are differences in people's fundamental beliefs about what is good
    and bad, right and wrong. When people<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" size="3">=</font><font size="3">s values differ significantly, the resulting conflict is often very hard to
    resolve, as people are not willing to change or compromise their fundamental values and
    beliefs.</font><big> </big><b></dd>
  </b>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><b>Values</b></dt>
  <dd>Values are the ideas we have about what is good and what is bad, and how things should
    be. We have values about family relationships (regarding, for instance, the role of the
    husband with respect to the wife), about work relationships (regarding, for instance, how
    employers should treat employees) and about other personal and relationships issues
    (regarding, for example, how children should behave towards adults, or how people should
    follow particular religious beliefs).<b> </b></dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><b>Win-Lose (Adversarial) Approach </b></dt>
  <dd>This is the approach to conflict taken by people who view the opponent as an adversary
    to be defeated. It assumes that in order to win, the opponent must lose. This is opposite
    to the win-win approach to conflict that assumes that if the disputants cooperate, a
    solution which provides a victory for all sides can be found.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <b>
  <dt>Win-Win (Cooperative or Problem Solving) Approach</dt>
  <b>
  <dd></b></b>This is the approach to conflict taken by people who want to find a solution
    that satisfies all the disputants. In &quot;win-win&quot; bargaining, the disputing
    parties try to cooperate to solve a joint problem in a way that allows both parties to
    &quot;win.&quot; This is contrasted with the &quot;win-lose&quot; (adversarial) approach
    to conflicts that assumes that all opponents are enemies and that in order to win a
    dispute, the opponent must lose. </dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><b><b>Win-Win Situations</dt>
  <dd></b></b>Game theory makes a distinction between positive-sum situations (often called
    &quot;games&quot;) which everyone can win (also referred to as &quot;win-win&quot;),
    negative sum games (also referred to as &quot;lose-lose&quot;), and zero-sum games in
    which one side wins only if another side loses. <b><b></dd>

  <dt><b><b>World view</b></b></dt>
  <dd>A world view is a person'<font size="3">s fundamental image of the world--one<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font></font>s set of core beliefs about how their social
    environment is put together. It involves one'<font size="3">s fundamental values about
    what is good and bad; it involves beliefs about who does what and why; it involves
    assumptions about what causes events and what those events might later cause. World views
    are closely linked with a person<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s sense of
    identity. People see themselves as part of some groups and not part of others, of having a
    particular role to play in society, and particular relationships with others. One</font><font SIZE="2">'</font>s image of who one is results from one's fundamental image of the world
    and one's image of how one relates to other people in it. </dd>

  <dt><strong>Zero-Sum Games or Situations</strong></dt>
  <font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><b>
  <dd></b></font><font size="3">Zero-sum games or situations are situations in which the only
    way one side can get ahead (or get more of something) is if the other side gets less. This
    occurs when there is a finite amount of a resource to be distributed, and the together the
    parties want more than is available. In this situation, no side can get what they want
    unless the other side gets less than they want. This is also referred to as win-lose
    situations.</font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><b></dd>
