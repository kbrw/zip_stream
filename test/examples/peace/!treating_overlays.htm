  <dd><font size="4">Interest-based framing describes conflicts in terms of interests, rather
    than positions. Often, interests are compatible, even when positions are not. Thus
    interest-based framing enables the parties to identify win-win solutions to problems that
    might not have been evident when the issues were described in terms of the parties'
    positions.<strong> </strong></font></dd>
  <dt><font size="4"><a name="fairfram"></a><a href="treatment/fairfram.htm"><strong>Fairness-Based
    Framing</strong></a></font></dt>
  <dd><font size="4">In fairness-based framing, the parties approach the conflict as an effort
    to obtain what is rightfully theirs. In doing this, they base their arguments on
    principles of fairness which are accepted by the larger society, including their more
    reasonable opponents. </font></dd>
  <dt><font size="4"><strong><a name="needfram"></a><a href="treatment/needfram.htm">Needs-Based
    Framing</a></strong></font></dt>
  <dd><font size="4">This approach frames a conflict as a collective effort to fulfill the
    fundamental human needs of all parties. By eliminating the tensions that arise when these
    needs go unmet, the approach can sharply reduce the level of conflict. </font></dd>

    Reframing/Assisted Reframing</a></strong></font></dt>
  <dd><font size="4">When opponents in a conflict each define, or frame, the conflict in very
    different terms it can make cooperative problem solving very difficult. An exercise in
    joint reframing can help each side see the conflict as the other side sees it, which can
    help both sides confront the situation in a more constructive way. It can even be helpful
    to get an outside observer to help one side alone assess the conflict to be sure their
    view is reasonably fair and accurate. </font></dd>

    (or Win-Win) Reframing</a></strong></font></dt>
  <dd><font size="4">Conflicts can usually be defined in a variety of ways. When conflicts are
    being approached as unavoidable win-lose situations, it is often useful to ask whether it
    is possible to redefine the situation so that integrative (or win-win) solutions can be
    obtained. This is especially important when the original problem definition leaves no
    acceptable alternatives for the opponent. Although integrative reframing is not always
    possible, often it is possible to reframe at least part of the conflict in this way. </font></dd>
  <dt><font size="4"><strong><a name="mirror"></a><a href="treatment/mirror.htm">Mirror
    Imaging</a></strong></font></dt>
  <dd><font size="4">Mirror imaging is a strategy which parties can use to assess the
    reasonableness of their behavior. It asks the parties to look at themselves the way others
    see them and make appropriate changes if they do not like what they see. Often if
    disputants will look at themselves honestly, they will sometimes notice that they are
    doing the same kinds of things--name calling, deception, and rumor spreading, for
    example--that they fault their opponents for doing. Once this is understood, parties can
    change their behavior to appear more reasonable, without altering or undermining their
    true interests at all.</font></dd>

    Rather Than Challenging, the Situation </a></strong></font></dt>
  <dd><font size="4">All grievances and complaints do not have to be framed as conflicts.
    Sometimes it is wiser for the parties to conclude that the issue is not important enough
    to justify the cost of confrontation. In such cases, the issue can be resolved by simply
    &quot;agreeing to disagree&quot; or accepting the situation as another disagreeable, but
    unavoidable, fact of life. </font></dd>
  <dt><font size="4"><strong><a name="powrshar"></a><a href="treatment/powrshar.htm">Power
    Sharing</a></strong></font></dt>
  <dd><font size="4">Power sharing is a strategy for resolving disputes over who should have
    the most powerful position in the social hierarchy. Instead of fighting over who should
    have power over whom, power sharing relies upon the joint exercise of power. If conflicts
    can be reframed to focus on how such power sharing might take place, they can become much
    more constructive. </font></dd>
  <dt><font size="4"><strong><a name="goalclar"></a><a href="treatment/goalclar.htm">Goal

    and third party intervenors. After identifying the nature of the problem, figuring out
    what one wants and what a good end result would be is essential for determining how to
    respond to any conflict situation. </font></dd>

    and Borrowing Eloquent Statements of the Common Core Issues </a></strong></font></dt>
  <dd><font size="4">One way to clarify the core issues is for the parties to review eloquent
    statements from prominent individuals who have struggled with similar problems and found a
    compelling way to state the core issues. If one of these statements seems to reflect their
    situation it could be adapted to the new context and used as an effective way to frame the

    actually necessary to the healthy functioning of social groups, as it provides a way for
    interests to be balanced and mutual needs met. If the utility of conflict is understood,

    determine the scope of a conflict. It identifies parties, issues, and the larger context

  <dd><font size="4">A careful effort to identify all current and potential parties is
    necessary for effective conflict resolution. While some parties to a conflict are obvious,
    others remain hidden. Efforts should be made to figure out who might be affected by the
    outcome to a particular conflict, as well as who is currently concerned about the
    situation but has not yet become vocal.</font></dd>

    dispute effectively, it is important to recognize the history of the underlying conflict.
    This often explains why people feel the way they do, and can give hints about possible
    effective remedies for the current situation. </font></dd>

    time. In order to be able to effectively deal with one dispute, it is important to
    recognize other disputes that are linked to it and that may effect the outcome of the
    initial dispute. </font></dd>

    disputant(s) to help frame the conflict more objectively, the same is true to help them
    understand the scope of the conflict.&nbsp; This can be done by one side seeking an
    outside consultant to help them analyze the conflict; it can also be done with the other

    carefully attend to the messages that they receive. </font></dd>

    Stereotypes </strong></a></font></dt>
  <dd><font size="4">One of the most important communication techniques is also one of the
    simplest. The parties need to recognize that the stereotypes (overly simplistic images)
    that they have about their opponents (and allies) are likely to be inaccurate, and that a
    failure to correct these inaccuracies can easily lead to bad decisions. This recognition
    then provides the parties with the motivation that they need to correct misperceptions. </font></dd>

  <dd><font size="4">Unrealistic and overly hostile stereotypes can often be broken or at
    least limited when a party unexpectedly takes some type of conciliatory action which would
    have been unthinkable had the stereotype been true. Sometimes called &quot;disarming&quot;
    moves (though they have nothing to do with military disarmament), these are actions that
    are surprisingly reasonable. They help break down negative stereotypes as they prove that
    the enemy is actually reasonable and likable. </font></dd>

  <dd><font size="4">Active listening is designed to overcome poor listening practices by
    requiring parties to listen to and then restate their opponent's statements, emphasizing
    the feelings expressed as well as the substance. The purpose is to confirm that the
    listener accurately understands the message sent and acknowledges that message, although
    the listener is not required to agree. </font></dd>

    Listening </a></strong></font></dt>
  <dd><font size="4">Dialogic listening is similar to active listening, although it emphasizes
    conversation as a shared activity and stresses an open-ended, playful attitude toward the
    conversation. In addition, the parties focus on what is happening between them (rather
    than each party focusing on what is going on within the mind of the other), and it focuses
    on the present more than on the past or the future. </font></dd>
  <dt><font size="4"><strong><a name="shuttle"></a><a href="treatment/shuttle.htm">Shuttle
    Diplomacy /Mediated Communication </a></strong></font></dt>
  <dd><font size="4">When hostility between parties reaches the point where they refuse to
    talk to each other, communication can often be re-established by a mutually-trusted third
    party who shuttles back and forth between opposing sides carrying messages. In some cases,
    these third parties may go beyond simple communication and assume the role of a mediator. </font></dd>
  <dt><font size="4"><strong><a name="dialog2"></a><a href="treatment/dialog2.htm">Dialogue</a></strong></font></dt>
  <dd><font size="4">Dialogue is a structured form of communication which emphasizes
    respectful and attentive listening about deep-rooted feelings, beliefs and
    experiences.&nbsp; In many cases, the parties may be unwilling to participate in a
    negotiation process because they don't want to compromise their deeply-held values.
    Nevertheless, they may be willing to participate in a dialogue where the objective is for
    the parties to better understand each other and establish a positive relationship with
    each other without being pressured to change their own views. </font></dd>

    informal representatives may provide a workable alternative. Originally formulated as
    &quot;track two diplomacy&quot; to be differentiated from, but supportive of, official or

    processes. One is the principle of majority rule, where issues are discussed, proposals
    are made and then the electorate, legislative bodies, and/or decision making committees
    vote on issues and the majority wins. This has the advantage of being generally accepted
    as fair, and it can be a relatively quick decision making strategy. However, it does
    little or nothing to satisfy the losers, who are likely to try to build power so that they
    can overturn the decision at a later time. </font></dd>

    they are simultaneously willing to grant others their wishes. This approach works better
    than majority rule in satisfying all the parties, except in situations where opposing
    parties have absolutely irreconcilable and contradictory interests. Another problem with
    consensus processes is that they can be very slow--majority rule (voting) is usually much

    conflicts intentionally, without recognizing the problems this can cause. By simply

    instantaneous decisions of great importance. Under such circumstances, people commonly act
    in overly confrontational ways which they later regret. One strategy for limiting this
    problem is for the parties to agree to a &quot;cooling-off&quot; period, during which
    everyone can re-evaluate the situation and make more carefully reasoned decisions. A
    related strategy involves the restructuring of forces (usually military) in ways which
    make instantaneous responses impossible. </font></dd>

    strategy for starting a de-escalation spiral is what Charles Osgood called GRIT--graduated
    reciprocal reductions in tension. This involves one side making a small conciliatory
    gesture, which they hope is matched by a conciliatory response. If it is not, a second or
    third small gesture can be made to indicate one's interest and willingness to de-escalate
    the conflict. Once the opponent reciprocates, another slightly more important conciliatory
    step can be taken, and if that is matched, the pattern can be continued, resulting in a
    cycle of conciliation in place of the former cycle of escalation. </font></dd>

    publicly and forcefully condemning their actions. In extreme cases involving criminal
    behavior, this may even require the parties to cooperate with law enforcement officers.
    Excluding extremists from meetings and negotiations can also be helpful at times, although
    it can cause problems later if the extremists try to block an agreement because they were

    view the conflict as a personal issue, rather than an effort to advance the group's
    interests. In this situation they are likely to let their personal feelings interfere with
    their ability to pursue the group's goals. More progress toward group goals can often be

    are impossible without placing the peacekeepers at risk. To be effective, peacekeepers
