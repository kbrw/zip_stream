<h3><a href="treatment/lefitfc.htm"><strong>Legitimatizing the Use of Force</strong></a></h3>

<p>In the development and implementation of force-based strategies, there are a number of
steps which the parties can take to increase the legitimacy of their actions, and reduce
the risk of backlash. Most of these involve limiting the extent and type of force, and by
linking force to other power options, especially integrative and exchange (negotiation)
options. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: Backlash; Use of Excessive Force. Example Links: 5244;

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/negloopb.htm">Step-by-Step Application of Force with
Negotiation Loop-backs</a></strong></h3>

<p>Force and loopback processes can be employed in a step-by-step fashion in which a party
begins with a modest demonstration of the force-based power and then attempts to negotiate
to see if some type of acceptable agreement on the immediate dispute might be possible. If
agreement is not possible, they can then step up the use of force and repeat the process.

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/shortcut.htm">Forcing Power Shortcuts </a></strong></h3>

<p>Forcing power shortcuts are designed to provide the parties with accurate and low-cost
forecasts of the likely outcome of pursuing forcing-power contests to their ultimate
conclusion. By using shortcuts, however, the terrible costs of protracted power contests
can be avoided. These forecasts can then be used as a basis for negotiation. Examples of
such shortcuts include: public opinion polls (in place of elections); arbitration or
mini-trails (in place of litigation); and relative military force assessments (in place of
military confrontations).<strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Problem Links: Pursuing force to the bitter end; use of

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/lefitfc.htm">Use of Less Destructive Force Types</a></strong></h3>

<p>The legitimacy of using force is increased when the parties use the least destructive
type of force which is also consistent with an effective defense of their interests. For
example, an attempt to work within existing laws should precede efforts to change those
laws by political or other means. Similarly, diplomatic solutions should be pursued before
military solutions.<strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Problem Link: Counterthreat; Use of Excessive force; You are

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/optioniv.htm">Option Inventory</a></strong></h3>

<p>This technique involves the systematic identification of the force-based options which

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/costing.htm">Costing </a></strong></h3>

<p>Costing is a strategy in which the parties systematically evaluate potential benefits,
as well as the costs and risks involved in each option they are considering. Even when
costs and benefits are considered disputants often underestimate the costs and
overestimate the benefits of using force. Problem Links: Neglecting the costs and risk of

than those based upon personal attacks. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: INSERT. Example Link:

<h3><strong><a href="problem/defense.htm">Violent defense</a></strong></h3>

<p>Violence is usually considered legitimate if it is used in self defense, although it
should not be considered the only or necessarily the best option available. The likely
benefits, costs, and risks of using force should be compared with alternative nonviolent
approaches to defense. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: You are a victim of force or violence;

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/collsec.htm">Collective Security</a></strong></h3>

<p>Collective security agreements call upon participating parties to jointly oppose any

agreement.<strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Problem Link: counterthreat; you are a victim of force or violence;

<h3><strong><a href="problem/counthrt.htm">Deterrence</a></strong></h3>

<p>Deterrence is a strategy for resisting the threatening actions of others through the
making of counter threats. While the approach is often effective it can also be dangerous.
It can result in an &quot;arms race&quot; effect in which the competing sides work to make
ever more powerful threats. Deterrence can also break down forcing the parties to either
admit that they were bluffing or carry out their threats. This can result in the kind of
destructive confrontation which deterrence was intended to avoid.<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Problem Link:

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/civdefs.htm">Civilian Defense </a></strong></h3>

<p>Civilian defense strategies attempt to deter violent aggression by promising a

prevent aggressors from benefiting from their actions. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Problem Link: You are a

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/empower.htm">Empowerment</a></strong></h3>

<p>Empowerment strategies are designed to help traditionally disempowered groups
strengthen their base of forcing power so that they can participate fairly and effectively
in dispute resolution processes. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Links: Power Imbalances; inexperienced

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/crimpros.htm">Criminal Justice</a></strong></h3>

<p>In cases where conflicts are found to involve criminal behavior on the part of specific
individuals, the criminal justice system with its police powers can be used against the
guilty parties.<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Problem Links: War Crimes (after the war); You are a victim of

Click on each problem for more information.</em> </p>

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/vote.htm">Voting/Elections</a></strong></h3>

<p>Often the parties will agree to the use of elections (often with judicial review) as
the ultimate source of power for dispute resolution efforts. This requires the parties to
forsake violence and promise to uphold the outcome of the election even when they are not
victorious. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: Vested interests; dictatorial process. Example Links:

Click on each problem for more information.</em> </p>

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/speace.htm">Stable Peace </a></strong></h3>

<p>Stable peace is a concept developed by Kenneth Boulding who said that stable peace is
obtained when the parties completely abandon the use of violent measures for advancing
their interests. Peace in this sense does not require that the underlying conflict be
resolved; it only requires a recognition that the costs of violent strategies are likely
to far exceed the benefits. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: INSERT; Example Link: " --></strong><em>For more information about

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/newskill.htm">Developing New Conflict Skills </a></strong></h3>

<p>The skills people have limit how they approach a conflict. Often people are more
skilled in force-based confrontation than they are in negotiation or integrative
strategies. By taking the time to develop new negotiation and integrative skills, leaders
and their constituents will be better able to engage in successful peacemaking and
peacebuilding efforts. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: Inexperienced Parties. Example Link: 7271." --> </strong><em>For

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/pkeeping.htm">Peacekeeping </a></strong></h3>

<p>Peacekeeping involves putting neutral intermediaries between fighting factions to
physically keep them apart. This can cool down a conflict enough to allow for successful
peace making (the development of a settlement agreement) and long-term peacebuilding (the
re-establishment of normal relations).<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Problem Link: Violence. Example Link:

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/peacezns.htm">Peace Zones</a></strong></h3>

<p>Peace Zones are proposed international zones which could be administered by the United
Nations for the benefit of all the people who live there and care about the region. The
establishment of an international Peace Zone had been suggested for Jerusalem, for
example, so that it could remain open to the three main religious groups which have roots
there.<em> For more information about this approach &quot;click&quot; on the title</em></p>

admission of guilt, the paying of reparations, the asking of forgiveness, and the granting
of amnesty. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=",Example Link:  6811, 6186,6187, 6302,6186,5970,6187b, 6290, 6302, 6557,6581,6592,7042,6066,3285,6187" --><em>For more information about this approach &quot;click&quot; on the title</em></p>

<h3><strong><a href="problem/counthrt.htm">Counterthreat </a></strong></h3>

<p>Sometimes these best response to a threat is to threaten back. This usually escalates
the conflict, but if the first disputant is bluffing, a counterthreat may encourage them
to take back their threat and utilize a more conciliatory strategy instead. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="

<h3><strong><a href="problem/defy.htm">Defiance</a></strong></h3>

<p>Another approach to a threat is to refuse to do what is demanded, but without issuing a
threat in return. Essentially, defiance means ignoring the threat or &quot;just saying
no.&quot; This doesn't escalate a conflict as much as a counterthreat does, though it does
risk that the threat will be carried out. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: You are a victim of

<p>External intervention is the involvement of an external power (another country, for

nonmilitary. Among the non-military options are positive or negative sanctions (rewards
and punishments for certain behaviors), mediation, and peacekeeping. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/non_force.htm">Use of the integrative system to respond to
and end force</a></strong></h3>

<p>Although most people tend to respond to force with counterforce, it is often equally or
more effective to use an integrative strategy to respond to the threat or use of force.
This makes the disputant using the force to look bad in the eyes of outsiders (sometimes
among their own people as well) and makes it hard to sustain the use of force when the
opponent is responding with integrative strategies. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Problem Link: You are a

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/facsavsr.htm">Face-saving surrender</a></strong></h3>

<p>Losing parties are much more likely to agree to end a struggle if they are given a way
out of the situation that is not terribly embarrassing, and does not force them to admit
they lost. If there is some way to frame the outcome of the dispute so all sides can claim
at least some success, it will make it much easier for the losing side to back down.<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/reloser.htm">Re-integration of Losers</a></strong></h3>

<p>It also is important that losing parties be reintegrated into the society. People do
not just go away, but they must continue to live somewhere most often where they have been
living before. For this reason, disputes must end with a plan that specifies how all the
parties will live together in the future.<strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Problem Link: ??* Example Link: 1975." --> </strong><em>For more information

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/crimpros.htm">Criminal Prosecution</a></strong></h3>

<p>Two approaches are available for dealing with war crimes and other excessive violence
related to protracted conflicts. One is acknowledgment, apology, and amnesty; the other is
criminal prosecution. Both have costs and benefits. The benefits of criminal prosecution
is that it makes people responsible for what they did; it brings some sense of justice to
a society; and it gives a sense of finality, of ending to a violent confrontation. The
costs of this approach are substantial, however, both practical and moral, and its pursuit
may inhibit the ability of the parties to end the struggle. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: You are

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/intopts.htm">Identify Integrative Options</a></strong></h3>

<p>Often integrative options are not considered because they are thought to be unavailable

disputants make.<strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Problem Link: Neglecting Opportunities for Persuasion Example

things which opponents find extremely hurtful. In these cases an integrative approach,
which focuses upon the acknowledgment of past guilt, the payment of appropriate
compensation, and the granting of forgiveness, can do much to help the parties strengthen

confrontations recover from the crimes and atrocities which occurred. These commissions
can provide a formal mechanism to publicly account for what happened, apologize and
forgive. This can be very helpful in the overall peacebuilding process, allowing
reconciliation between previously warring groups.<strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Problem Link: Dehumanization;

construct a situation in which is it impossible for the parties to ignore the hypocrisy of
their own actions. Such actions might, for example, involve carefully-structured public

interpersonal understanding and trust between groups, or they can go so far as to explore
options for dispute settlement. Often citizens can say things and suggest ideas that

accept an agreement that is obtained if they have not be involved in the process enough to
understand why the agreement was designed as it was (especially why certain compromises

<p>Hard bargaining strategies emphasize results over relationships. Hard bargainers will
insist that their demands be completely agreed to and accepted before any agreement is
possible. While this approach avoids the need to make concessions, it also reduces the
likelihood of successfully negotiating an agreement, and usually harms the relationship
with the other party as well. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: INSERT Example Link: INSERT" --> </strong><em>For more information

to bargain over who is going to get how much. Distributive bargaining tends to be much
more competitive and adversarial than principled negotiation, as each party tries to do
better than the other in the negotiation.</p>

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/empower.htm">Empowerment</a></strong></h3>

<p>People or groups involved in intractable conflicts are almost always better off if they
carefully assess their sources of power and build up those sources of power as much as
possible before confronting their opponents. (Keep in mind that &quot;power&quot; is being
used here in a broad sense, to include exchange and integrative strategies as well as
force). Empowerment also involves developing a strategy for using power wisely employing a
mix of constructive confrontation techniques which are most likely to produce benefits
with the lowest costs. Empowerment is especially important to groups which start out in a
low-power position, which puts them at a disadvantage in almost all confrontational
situations.<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Problem Link: large power disparities ??* Example Links: 6271; 6282;

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/adavr.htm">Advocacy advisors</a></strong></h3>

<p>While strategic planning can be done by disputing parties on their own, sometimes it is
useful to obtain outside advice from an outside consultant, who can provide insight into
different confrontation options. Advocacy advisors intervene in a conflict on behalf of
one of the parties and not as a neutral intermediary. Their goal is to apply their
knowledge of conflict processes to the party's effort to advance their own interests.
Differing types of advocacy advisors specialize in different approaches to conflict. For
example, lawyers specialize in litigation-based strategies, political advisors specialize
in elections, lobbyist specialize in influencing the legislative process, labor organizers
specialize in strikes and other job actions, community organizers specialize in
non-violent direct action while religious leaders specialize in moral arguments and
military advisors specialized in armed conflict. There can also be general advocacy
advisors who show the parties how all of these strategies might be used in combination.<strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/anps.htm">Analytical Problem Solving </a></strong></h3>

<p>Analytical problem solving is an approach to difficult conflicts developed by John
Burton, Herbert Kelman, and others which focuses upon systematically analyzing a conflict
to determine the degree to which fundamental human needs of the parties are being met. In
cases where there are significant unmet needs, analytical problem solving focuses upon
meeting these needs as a way of resolving the conflict. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: Escalation;

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/contrns.htm">Conflict Transformation</a></strong></h3>

<p>Many scholars and practitioners are beginning to focus more on the goal of transforming
conflicts, rather than resolving them. Transformation refers to a change in the nature of
the relationship between the disputing parties, not just a settlement of interest-based
differences. The ultimate goal of conflict transformation is reconciliation a return to
normal relations between disputing groups where each side accepts the legitimacy of the
other's identity and aspirations, apologizes for and forgives the other for, past
aggressive or violent acts.<strong> </strong><em>For more information about this approach

is different from the more common problem-solving approach to mediation which emphasizes

<p>Dispute systems design is a concept first presented in <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Getting Disputes
Resolved" --> </strong>by William Ury , Jeanne
Brett, and Stephen Goldberg. Dispute handling systems are designed for organizations and
communities that have to deal with a continuing series of disputes over similar issues.
The goal of dispute system design is to develop and implement a system which directs each
dispute to the appropriate dispute handling process. While interest-based processes are
appropriate in most cases, Ury, Brett, and Goldberg recognized that there are also
disputes which must be resolved on the basis of rights, as well as those which are
resolved by determining who is more powerful. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem

<h3><strong><a href="treatment/realtest.htm">Reality Testing </a></strong></h3>

<p>In deciding which conflict management strategy is most promising, parties must make
assumptions about their own power, their opponent's power, and the likely outcomes of
different options. It is easy to make inaccurate assessments of any of these factors,
however. Often an outside party can help review the accuracy of these assumptions and help
you revise them appropriate when they are invalid. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: Inadequate

<p>Preventative diplomacy or conflict prevention analyzes current problems and trends to

then be taken to remedy the situation before the conflict escalates so much that it
becomes difficult to deal with. If successful this approach can eliminate the need for
dispute resolution activities by avoiding the conflict in the first place. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem

<p>Constructive confrontation is a strategy developed by Guy Burgess and Heidi Burgess

particular conflict problems, and then designing remedies for those problems so that the
resulting conflict is more constructive.<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Problem Link:EVERYTHING?? Example Link:

choice but to make a win-lose decision, or to arbitrarily &quot;cut the difference in
half&quot; which may make little sense either. Expanding the number of options being
considered, and especially coming up with creative approaches to developing win-win
solutions can often yield better decisions. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Problem Link: Assuming Force is Only
