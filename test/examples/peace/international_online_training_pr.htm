<hr>

<p>This website contains a set of materials designed to help people better deal with
difficult, long-lasting, and resolution-resistant conflicts. Some of the materials are
theoretical--they discuss the nature of conflicts and conflict processes, and they discuss
what conflict theory tells us about ways conflicts can be most constructively approached.
Other materials are practical. They discuss typical conflict problems and potential
solutions. While the practical material draws upon theory, it is largely based on
practical experience and is designed to provide solutions to particular problems.</p>

<p>This overview is organized into the following sections:

<h2><a name="Ways to Use"></a>The Ways in Which This Program Can be Used</h2>

<p>This program can be used in a variety of ways. It can be searched quickly to find a
solution to a particular problem. Or it can be studied in some detail--to learn more about
resolution-resistant conflicts in general and how they can be most effectively approached.
The program can be used by itself by people who have little or no experience in conflict
management. It can also be used, however, to supplement other conflict management training
or reading. Since we take a somewhat different approach to conflict management and
resolution than is common among our colleagues, the material on this website is likely to
give users a new perspective and additional ideas about how best to confront difficult
conflict situations.</p>

<p>All the information on this web-site is available for free. Users can study as much or
as little as they wish without incurring any costs (beyond computer access costs).
However, a certificate of completion and/or university credit is available (for a small
fee) for those who want to work through the formal course material and complete the
assignments. For more information on these options, choose one of the items below. 

<dl>
  <dt><strong><a href="online_consulting.htm">Online Consulting</a></strong> </dt>
  <dd>Our on-line consulting service begins by presenting a list of typical conflict problems.
    &nbsp; Potential solutions to each problem are then offered along with examples and
    background information.&nbsp; People who just want a limited amount of information about a
    few problems should use this approach to the system.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a href="training_options.htm">Online Training and Education</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>The training and education option is available for people who want more information
    about a broader range of topics.&nbsp; In addition to the problem and solution material
    used for online consulting, people wanting more extensive training or education should
    read the background theoretical essays, as well as the examples which are linked to the
    problem and solution write up. The core training program consists of ten basic units--one
    on the introductory theory, and nine others, each focusing on a particlar category of
    problem. Each unit has a overview section and a number of more specialized sub-sections
    describing common problems and potential solutions.&nbsp; Examples give more information
    about particular problems, or how solutions have been applied in different situations.</dd>

<h2><a name="Theory"></a>The Theoretical Ideas Underlying This Program</h2>

<p>The approach we take to deal with difficult and resolution-resistant conflicts draws
ideas from several fields. It draws heavily from the new fields of conflict resolution and
peace research, utilizing the wisdom of practitioners as well as scholars. It also draws
ideas from experts in advocacy, community organization, and nonviolent direct action.
Unlike those who seek resolution for the sake of resolution, we seek justice, fairness,
good decisions, and good solutions. Sometimes this means working to resolve a conflict,
while sometimes it means continuing the conflict, but doing so in a more constructive way.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
The following papers provide additional information the history of the field of conflict
resolution (which puts our work in its contexts), and about the approach we call
constructive confrontation. </p>

  <dt><strong><a href="multilingual_information.htm">Multilingual Capabilities</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Although all of the material is now available only in English, we have tried to write in
    a style that we hope will be understandable to people with limited English skills. An
    online dictionary provides definitions of specialized terms which may not be found in
    standard translations dictionaries. We are also including multilingual program
    descriptions.<font color="#800000"> </font>As a further translation aid, we have included
    a link to AltaVista's free online translation service. While this is primitive and should
    be used with caution, it may still be useful.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a href="online_disc.htm">Online Discussions and Listserver</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>An online discussion and listserve is being established for this program.&nbsp; Links to
    other listserves of interest are also given. </dd>

<h2><a name="Developers"></a>The People and Organizations Who Developed and Funded This
Program</h2>

<dl>
  <dt><strong><a href="crc_org.htm">University of Colorado Conflict Research Consortium</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>This program has been developed by the University of Colorado Conflict Research
    Consortium, a university-based research program in the United States, specializing in
    improving the understanding of and ability to handle resolution-resistant conflicts. In
    addition to focusing on intractable conflicts, the Consortium has worked for many years to
    assemble what we consider to be the core knowledge of the conflict resolution field and to
    present that knowledge in a format that is readily accessible and understandable to the
    general public. Earlier efforts to do this involved development of conflict resolution
    bibliographies, and an <a href="http://www.Colorado.EDU/conflict/encyann.htm"><em>Encyclopedia
    of Conflict Resolution</em></a>, written by Heidi Burgess and Guy Burgess and published by
    ABC-CLIO in 1997.&nbsp; The Consortium also maintains one of the most extensive web-sites
    on conflict resolution available on the World-Wide Web&nbsp; (<a
    href="http://www.colorado.edu/conflict">http://www.colorado.edu/conflict</a>).</dd>
  <dt><strong><a href="bios.htm">The People Who Developed This Program</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>This program has been developed by Guy Burgess, Heidi Burgess, and Paul Wehr. Guy
    Burgess and Heidi Burgess are Co-Directors of the University of Colorado Conflict Research
    Consortium, a university-based research program specializing in improving our
    understanding of and ability to handle resolution-resistant conflicts. Paul Wehr, a
    professor of Sociology, is also a founding member of the Consortium and has been an active
    member of the Intractable Conflict research program for many years. </dd>
