<h3><a HREF="problem/intnds-p.htm"><strong>Confusing material interests with fundamental
human needs</strong></a></h3>

<p>Many intractable conflicts involve the inability of one or more groups to secure their
fundamental human needs--for such things as identity, security, dignity, or control.
Often, however, the importance of these needs is overlooked, and conflicts are defined in
material terms only. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link: Needs Based Framing; Analytical Problem

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/incfrm.htm">Incompatible frames</a></strong></h3>

<p>Often, one party will define a conflict in terms of negotiable interests (that is,
material things that can be traded, such as wealth or land), while another defines the
conflict in terms of rights, values, or needs (all of which are intangible things that are
not usually considered negotiable). While such disagreements do not make resolution
completely impossible, they do make it harder to obtain.<strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Solution Link: Joint

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/compete.htm">Overly Competitive Approaches to a Conflict</a></strong></h3>

<p>People often approach disputes in a very competitive, win-lose way. They assume that
the only way they can win is if the other side loses. Consequently, they are very
competitive, seeking the best possible outcome for themselves, without considering how
this will affect people on the other side. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link:Principled Negotiation;

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/intosea.htm">&quot;Into-the-Sea&quot; Framing</a></strong></h3>

<p>Sometimes, disputants seem to want their opponent to disappear forever, as if they
could just be pushed &quot;into the sea&quot;. This kind of framing can lead to genocide
or to efforts to force opponents into exile. In less extreme situations, one side to a
conflict may demand concessions that their opponent cannot possibly accept. When conflicts
are approached in this way, protracted confrontation becomes inevitable. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/dehuman1.htm">De-humanization </a></strong></h3>

<p>Violent, catastrophic confrontations seldom occur unless the contending parties have
de- humanized one another. Once this de-humanization occurs, opponents are seen to have
almost no legitimate rights and all manners of atrocities are justifiable. The Geneva
conventions limit this effect somewhat by setting minimal standards for the treatment of
combatants. However, history has shown many examples of horrific treatment of civilians
both within and outside the context of war. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link: Dialogue;

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/confbad.htm">Framing Conflict as the Problem</a></strong></h3>

<p>{OLD TITLE Framing Conflict as Abnormal and Bad}Often people assume that any conflict
is abnormal and bad. However, conflict is a normal and unavoidable part of all
relationships and societies. It is even essential for the healthy functioning of a
relationship or social group, because conflict allows people to grow and change, adapting
to new situations and inventing new approaches to problems. What is bad (though also not
abnormal) is the destructive ways people commonly deal with conflicts ways that worsen the
problems associated with conflict and reduce the benefits the conflict could potentially
bring. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link: Constructive Confrontation. Example Link: 7274." --></strong> <em>For

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/Ambgoals.htm">Ambiguous goals </a></strong></h3>

<p>Often people who are confused about what the conflict is really about or what is
important to them will have ambiguous (that is, confused) goals. This often results in
ineffective actions which confuse or even enrage the other side, often needlessly. The
same thing can occur with third parties to enter a conflict to &quot;help.&quot; If they
do not understand what their own goals are for involvement, they can easily do more harm
than good. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link: Goal Clarification. Example Link: 5338; 7269. " --></strong><em>For

overlook some people who are likely to be affected by the conflict situation or the

<p>In addition to failing to identify people or groups who might be involved in a
conflict, disputants can also overlook issues which are important to others, but are not
important to themselves. Often people will not realize that there is more than one way to
see a situation, and that other people or groups may see the conflict differently than
they do. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Solution Link: Mapping; Communication Improvement Strategies" --></strong>. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Example Links: 6030, 364, 6319, 7269, 5746 (-)* Aspen Rpt 96*" --></strong> <em>For more information about this problem &quot;click&quot; on the title.</em></p>

prevailing definition of justice is set by the group in power, while low- power groups see
their inferior position as unjust. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link:Fairness Based Framing; Needs

for a long time. Understanding the importance of the way the conflict was handled in the

<p>When conflicts are complex--involving a large number of disputants and/or issues--
parties must be able to gather a great deal of information before they can plan an
effective confrontation strategy. Often time or resource limitations prevent adequate
information gathering. In other circumstances, information is collected, but it is
interpreted incorrectly. In either case, the result is likely to inhibit effective action.

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/stereoty.htm">Inaccurate and Overly Hostile Stereotypes</a></strong></h3>

<p>Often, communication difficulties arise because people think they know all they need to
know about their opponents and that further communication is unnecessary. Yet images of
opponents tend to be overly hostile and exaggerated. Opponents are seen to be more extreme
and outrageous than they really are. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link: Breaking Down Inaccurate

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/infogat-p.htm">Inadequate Information Gathering </a></strong></h3>

<p>Gathering the information needed to sensibly deal with conflict situations is also
time- consuming and expensive. In some cases, misunderstandings will arise because of the
failure of the parties to invest the time and resources required to obtain important
information. When direct communication is cut off, it is easy to rely on unreliable third
party sources--rumor, and media stories especially. These are notoriously error-prone, and
can lead to serious misunderstandings. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link: Rumor Control Teams;

<p>In protracted conflicts, the people involved continually change. Often those playing
key leadership roles give up their positions and other individuals take their place. In
many cases these new participants have a very limited understanding of the conflict's
history and the current situation. This lack of information can lead these people to take
actions which they would not have taken, had they been better informed. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution

<p>People often view conflicts from very different perspectives depending upon such things

to communicate effectively, they need to understand (though not necessarily agree with)
the perspectives of other parties to a conflict. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="&lt;strong&gt;Solution Link: Improved

<p>Another aspect of cultural differences is that culture affects both the substance and
style of communication. Culture influences how people express themselves, to whom they
talk, and how. For example, while some people may feel comfortable talking openly about
their feelings with anyone, others will only talk openly and honestly with very close
friends, others may not talk that way at all. Such differences can cause people from
different cultures to misinterpret both what is said, and what is left unsaid, leading to
misunderstandings. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link: Dialogue" --></strong>; <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Cross Cultural

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/poorlist.htm">Poor Listening Skills</a></strong></h3>

<p>Successful communication requires that the parties listen actively and
carefully--asking questions and confirming interpretations to make sure they understand
what the other person is meaning. People seldom work this hard at listening, however.
Often in conflictual situations, they hardly listen at all, but rather spend the time
their opponent is talking planning their own response. This frequently leads to
misunderstandings. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link: Active Listening; Dialogic Listening. Example

clearly as they are originally spoken. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link: Active Listening;

when governments keep secrets for &quot;security&quot; reasons. This can also happen in

others outside the immediate circle. If these small group processes are intended to have
any wider effect, it is necessary to transfer the learning that takes place in the small
group to the larger constituencies which the group represents. Often, however,

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/uwpublic.htm">Unwanted Publicity </a></strong></h3>

<p>Negative and inflammatory publicity is a problem in conflicts--before, during, and
negotiations. Before negotiations, the media can intensify a controversy, making it harder
to get people to work together or even talk. In the early stages of negotiation parties
often advance tentative ideas which could easily backfire if publicized. The resulting
outcry and complaints can easily undermine an otherwise promising negotiation effort. Even
after negotiated solutions have been developed, negative publicity can rekindle conflicts,
making implementation of agreements more difficult.<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link: Confidential

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/polariz.htm">Polarization</a></strong></h3>

<p>In an effort to build their power base, parties often seek alliances with as many other
interest groups as possible. These groups agree to help each other as they pursue their
separate objectives. In order to remain competitive, interest groups have to form as many
alliances as possible. Over time, this process tends to divide communities into two large
and opposing alliances in a process called polarization. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link:

<p>Escalation can be intensified when the parties use tactics which personally attack the
integrity and character of their opponents. This can change the character of a conflict so
that personal hatreds and vindictiveness, rather than the pursuit of just solutions,
dominate the debate. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link: Stereotype-breaking actions (disarming

<p>The escalation of a conflict to the point of violent confrontation can change a
conflict so that concern over substantive issues and questions of justice is replaced by
fear, hatred, and a desire for self-defense and vengeance. These effects are compounded
when the use of violence is seen as excessive, illegitimate, or unnecessary. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution

<p>Often parties involved in serious conflicts are called upon to make enormous sacrifices
including, in violent conflicts, the loss of human lives. Once such sacrifices have been
made, it is extremely difficult for leaders to admit that they have made a mistake and the
sacrifices were unnecessary. This reluctance to admit past errors often leads the parties
to pursue destructive strategies long after their destructiveness and futility has become
apparent. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Solution Link: Costing; Face SavingExample Link: 6030" --></strong> <em>For more

<p>As conflicts escalate, public interest and willingness to take sides generally
increases. This can lead to substantial increases in the level of support enjoyed by some
or all of the parties. Knowing this, disputants often deliberately escalate conflicts in
order to build support. While this approach can be effective, it usually generates support
for the other side as well. The result is often an intensification of the conflict with
little change in the relative power of the parties. Solution Link: Mobilization;

<h3><strong><a HREF="problem/extremist.htm">Extremists</a></strong></h3>

<p>Most interest groups have supporters who take an extreme view of the conflict. These
extremists tend to favor outrageous and often violent tactics. They are also likely to be
very reluctant to accept any form of compromise. In their pursuit of complete victory,
extremists often take aggressive actions which other members of the group oppose. Problems
arise when these extremists become viewed as representing the views and tactics of the
larger group. This tends to lead opponents to conclude that they must respond with extreme
tactics of their own. The provocative actions of extremists can also threaten broadly
supported efforts to de-escalate conflicts. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Solution Link: Power Strategy Mix;

<p>In crisis situations, disputants are often forced to make important decisions very
quickly with information which is usually incomplete and unreliable. Given such
uncertainty, decision makers often feel that they must take a cautious, worst-case
approach and assume that their opponents are acting in the most threatening way possible.
This often leads the parties to take more forceful actions than necessary, which
dramatically intensifies the conflict. For example, in cases where military forces are on
a hair-trigger alert, parties are under intense pressure to respond instantly and
forcefully for fear that the other party's quick action will allow them to seize the
advantage. <strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Solution Link: Hotline; Crisis Communication Mechanisms. Example

neither party has the power to win, and neither party is willing to back down or admit
defeat. This can be extremely destructive to all sides, as they continue to pour resources
and lives into the struggle, with little or no hope of victory. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link:

have no legitimate rights and all manners of atrocities are considered justifiable. The
