Conflict, 2nd ed., (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1996).</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mediation and Dispute Resolution</p>

<p>There are a number of ways to approach conflict management and resolution, which range
from least to most coercive. Conflicts may be avoided, talked out, negotiated, arbitrated,
adjudicated, resolved by legislation, by political action, or by violent force. </p>

<p>Moore is concerned primarily with the mediated approach to conflict management. Parties
who cannot negotiate together effectively may bring a mediator to facilitate the
negotiation process. Mediation is defined as &quot;the intervention in a standard
negotiation or conflict of an acceptable third party who has limited or no authoritative
decision-making power but who assists the involved parties in voluntarily reaching a
mutually acceptable settlement of issues in dispute.&quot;[p. 15] Within this definition
mediators may play a number of different roles, and may enter conflicts at a variety of
different levels of development or intensity. Moore reviews the history of mediation and
its contemporary practice. He describes very briefly how mediation has been practiced in
various non-Western cultures.</p>

<p>Moore describes three general mediator roles: social network mediators, authoritative
mediators, and independent mediators. Social network mediators are usually respected
members of the community who have existing relationships with the parties. While not
neutral, they are perceived as being fair. Social network mediators are generally
concerned with maintaining stable long-term social relations. Generally they remain
involved with the parties after the negotiations, and will participate in implementing
agreements. They are able to draw on social or peer pressure to enforce agreements.
Authoritative mediators are individuals who are in some position of authority over the
parties, such as a manager or director. There are a number of differences among
authoritative mediators. They may be neutral as to the outcome, or may have vested
interests in achieving a particular settlement. Such mediators are generally able to use
their authority to enforce agreements. Independent mediators are best defined by their
neutrality and impartiality. Generally they have no prior relationship to the parties, and
are hired by the joint decision of the parties. Independent mediators seek to help the
parties develop voluntary, mutually acceptable solutions. The independent mediator model
is most commonly used in western countries, however it is increasingly being used by other
cultures as well.</p>

<p>Mediators of all types draw upon two broad classes of tactics: general tactics and
contingent tactics. General tactics are kinds of interventions that mediators use in
almost all conflicts. They include tactics for entering the dispute, analyzing the
conflict, planning the mediation, identifying parties' interests, facilitating parties'
negotiations and helping them generate proposals, drafting agreements and developing
implementation plans. A key mediator activity is to identify the causes of the conflict,
and to build a hypothesis as to how the conflict might be resolved. Contingent tactics are
those used to handle the special problems which can arise during negotiations. Contingent
tactics may be used to address such problems as value clashes, power imbalances,
destructive patterns of interaction, communication problems, strong emotions,
misinformation and differing analyses.</p>

<p>There are a number of factors which influence choice of mediation strategies. They
include the stage of the conflict and the parties' abilities to resolve their dispute, the
balance of power between the parties, which negotiation procedures are being used, how
complex the issues are, and what the parties expect from the mediator. In crafting a
mediation strategy the mediator must decide on the level, target and focus of
intervention. The mediator decides whether to concentrate on the level of general
problem-solving, or on a specific issue. She decides who she should be directing her
activities toward. She also decides whether to focus on psychological, procedural, or
substantive aspects of the conflict. </p>

<p>Before Negotiations Begin</p>

<p>Mediators may enter disputes at the request of the parties, or by being appointed by an
authoritative third-party. The mediator has four main tasks at this stage. First, she must
build credibility with the disputants. The parties must have confidence in the mediator
personally, the mediator's parent organization, and in the mediation process itself.
Second, the mediator must create a relatively close, comfortable relationship with the
parties. Third, the parties must be educated about the mediation process, since it is
ultimately the parties themselves who must resolve their dispute. This education also
helps build confidence in the mediation process. Finally, after these steps have been
taken, the mediator must secure the parties' commitment to mediation. This commitment may
range from an informal oral agreement to a formal written contract, depending upon the
situation. </p>

<p>Mediators may initiate contact with the parties in person or by phone or letter. Where
there is some barrier to contacting parties it may be helpful to have a secondary party
introduce the mediator. The timing of a mediator's entry depends upon what type of
intervention they plan to make. Interventions to collect data on the conflict can be
undertaken at almost any time. The proper timing of problem solving interventions is
disputed. Late intervention may allow the issues to develop more fully, and the disputants
to have exhausted their desire and ability to continue the conflict. Early intervention
may produce more cooperative, less coercive settlements and better relationships.</p>

<p>After the mediator has entered the dispute, the mediator and the parties must work
together to decide what mediation strategy is best suited to their situation. Moore
identifies six ways in which the mediator may assist the parties in choosing a mediation
strategy. First, the mediator can help the parties to identify the interests at stake in
the conflict, and to clarify their respective goals. Second they can help the parties
explore the range of possible, probable and acceptable outcomes. Outcomes may benefit both
parties, cost both parties, or benefit one at the other's expense. Third, the mediator
should describe the basic types of strategies for resolving disputes. The basic strategies
are competition, avoidance, accommodation, negotiated compromise, and interest-based
negotiation. Fourth, the mediator can help the parties to clarify the criteria that will
guide their choice of strategies. Parties' choice of strategies will be shaped by time
constraints, the nature of their current or desired relationship with the other party,
their power, and by the parties' internal dynamics. Fifth, the mediator can assist the
parties in weighing their options and reaching a decision. Finally, mediators can help the
parties coordinate their strategies into a coherent, consistent approach to the dispute.
Usually mediators and parties work together to analyze the conflict. Conflict analysis
begins with data collection directed by the mediator. Moore identifies six mediator
activities with contribute to effective data collection. First, the mediator supplies a
basic framework for understanding conflicts. Second, the mediator decides which data
collection methods to use. Data collection methods available include direct observations,
consultations with secondary sources such as maps or financial records, and interviews
with the involved parties. Third, the mediator may delegate the actual data collection
work. Interviews, in particular, will be more informative if the party identifies with the
interviewer. Fourth, these data collection activities should be coordinated within a
larger data collection strategy. This strategy should include an approach to identifying
all the relevant parties to the conflict, a plan for the order and timing of the
interviews, and a plan for building rapport with the parties. Fifth, the mediator should
choose an interview approach. Interviews may be focused or unfocused, structured or non-
structured, individual or joint. And finally the mediator must decide what sort of
questions to ask in the interviews, and must exercise good listening skills during the
interviews.</p>

<p>After the conflict data has been collected, it must be used to develop an
interpretation of the dispute. &quot;The mediator's central task during this stage is to
integrate and understand the elements of the dispute: people, dynamics, issues, and
interests.&quot;[p. 132] Timelines and case studies are two ways of integrating the data.
Discrepant data must be discreetly verified. Mediators can begin to develop an
interpretation of the conflict be separating unrealistic causes of the conflict from
realistic causes. Unrealistic causes include stereotypes, miscommunication, confusion over
the facts, and inappropriate competitive behavior. Realistic causes include competing
interests, differing values, structural constraints, and disagreement over the collection
or importance of data. In complex disputes the mediator may choose to share her analysis
with the parties.</p>

<p>Having secured the parties commitment and performed the conflict analysis, the
mediator's next task is to develop a detailed mediation plan. &quot;A mediation plan is a
sequence of procedural steps initiated by the intervenor that will assist negotiators in
exploring and reaching an agreement.&quot;[p. 141] In most cases the mediator and the
parties cooperate in developing a plan. A mediation plan should specify who will
participate in the negotiations, whether outside- parties may be present, where
negotiations will be held, and the physical arrangements of the negotiation space. The
plan will also anticipate whether positional or interest-based negotiation procedures will
be used, what interests and issues are most important to the parties, what the parties'
psychological conditions are, what deadlocks might arise and how they could be dealt with.
The plan will establish ground rules for appropriate behavior in negotiations and should
include a tentative agenda for the first meeting. Finally, the mediation plan includes a
plan for educating the parties about mediation and negotiation processes.</p>

<p>Throughout the negotiation process, mediators work to build trust and foster
cooperation. This activity is called conciliation. &quot;Conciliation is essentially an
applied psychological tactic aimed at correcting perceptions, reducing unreasonable fears,
and improving communication to an extent that permits reasonable discussion to take place
and, in fact, makes rational bargaining possible.&quot;[p. 161] Moore describes five basic
problems and the conciliation tactics which address those problems. Strong emotions can
block agreements and inhibit the development of positive relationships. Usually mediators
will allow the parties to vent their emotions in a controlled, safe setting. Venting may
be inappropriate in conflicts with a history of violence or emotional escalation. In such
cases mediators structure the negotiations to suppress emotions, and may even resort to a
kind of shuttle diplomacy. Stereotypes and misperceptions can be addressed by a four-step
process. The mediator identifies the parties' perceptions, assesses their accuracy,
assesses whether they help or hinder negotiations, and then helps the parties revise their
inaccurate or negative perceptions.</p>

<p>Parties may question the legitimacy of other negotiators, of issues or of emotions. The
legitimacy of negotiators may be established my revising misperceptions, and by explaining
or revising how the negotiator was chosen to participate. Issues may be recast in more
general or specific terms, may be redefined, or may be appealed to an independent
authority. Challenges to the legitimacy of the other side's feelings can be addressed by
exploring the reasons for those feelings, and pointing out that understanding another's
feelings does not entail agreeing with them. When the parties' trust in each other is low,
the mediator must suggest ways for the parties to build confidence in each other.
Mediators encourage the parties to be clear and consistent, to follow through promptly on
their promises, to expose small vulnerabilities to the other side, to accept penalties for
breaches of faith and to refrain from making threats. Parties may also be given joint
tasks to perform. Communication problems are common. Problems may occur with what, when,
where, how, by whom or to whom a message is communicated. The mediator must determine
where the problem is occurring, and then act to change the content, timing, setting,
manner, or agent of communication as appropriate. Mediators must also be attentive to
nonverbal forms of communication and miscommunication.</p>

<p>The Mediation Process</p>

<p>Mediators generally follow a common plan for the first mediation session. The session
begins with an opening statement by the mediator. The mediator's opening statement
introduces the mediator and the parties, defines the mediator's role, describes the
mediation procedures including mediator neutrality, confidentiality, and the use of
private caucuses, describes the meeting format, and suggests behavioral guidelines for the
sessions. The mediator may then answer questions from the parties. Next, the parties each
make an opening statement. Parties make a variety of different kinds of opening
statements. They typically focus either on substantive interests and issues, on a
combination of history, needs and positions, on the need for change, or on some
non-negotiable position. Occasionally they will focus on procedural concerns, or more
rarely on psychological conditions.</p>

<p>Moore notes that &quot;the most critical task for disputants at this stage is to
maximize accurate information exchange.&quot;[p. 209] Mediators facilitate this exchange
by using a number of communication tools. These tools include active listening,
paraphrasing and restatement, summarization, and probing or clarifying questions. The
mediator helps the parties to expand upon their messages, to structure their thoughts, to
group and order similar ideas, and to separate complex issues' component issues. A
positive emotional climate contributes to efficient communication. Mediators act to
maintain a positive emotional climate by controlling or diffusing negative emotions or
attacks, enforcing behavioral ground rules, and keeping parties focused on the issues. </p>

<p>Cultural differences may play a significant role in how negotiations begin. In cultures
which rely primarily on social network mediators, the opening stage may involve much more
informal conversation, and perhaps even food and drink. Authoritative mediators tend
toward more formal arrangements. This formality is a necessary way of showing respect in
more hierarchical cultures. High context, relatively homogenous cultures will spend less
time explicitly specifying the process that negotiations will follow. Low context or
heterogeneous parties will need to be more explicit. Communication styles also vary across
cultures. Moore observes that &quot;what for one culture appears to be rudeness,
interruption, and poor listening will be acceptable overlapping discussion in
another.&quot;[p. 212]</p>

<p>The next task is to set the negotiation agenda. The parties will need to identify the
broad topic areas of their concerns, identify specific issues of contention, and decide on
the order in which those issues will be discussed. Conflicts differ in the complexity and
ambiguity of their issues. Generally conflicts are either interest-based or value-based.
Value-based conflicts are less amenable to compromise and integration, and so mediators
should avoid describing disputes in terms of value differences when possible. The activity
of defining the issues is called framing or reframing. Mediators help the parties to frame
the issues in ways which will enable effective problem-solving. Interest-based disputes
can be reframed by either broadening or focusing the issues. Values-based disputes can be
reframed either by reinterpreting the issues as interests, avoiding the value elements, or
by appealing to broader shared values. Mediators tend to avoid using adversarial language,
and instead use neutral terminology in describing issues and disputes.</p>

<p>Having identified the issues, the parties must now develop an agenda. Moore suggests a
number of techniques for developing the agenda. Parties may address issues one at a time,
in an ad hoc manner. The parties may alternate choosing issues to discuss. They may work
from most to least important issues, or from easiest to more difficult issues. They may
start by identifying which issues are key, and which issues are contingent on other
agreements. They may package issues together to enable balanced trade-offs. Mediators are
familiar with the advantages and draw-backs of these different approaches, and can advise
the parties in agenda development.</p>

<p>Cultural differences can affect agenda development. Some aboriginal cultures prefer a
storytelling approach to presenting the conflict's history and issues. Many cultures avoid
direct confrontation, and will describe conflicts in indirect, oblique terms, or even in
third-person terms. Such indirect cultures may prefer to begin by addressing areas of
agreement, and by reinforcing existing relationships between the parties. Direct-dealing
cultures prefer explicit enumeration of the issues.</p>

<p>Parties are very rarely able to give a clear or complete statement if their interests.
Hence one of the mediator's important tasks is to uncover and clarify the parties hidden
interests. Parties may be unclear on their interests for a number of reasons. External
factors such as advise from friends or traditional explanations may cause parties to
misperceive their interests. Parties may intentionally hide their interests in an attempt
to gain a negotiating advantage. Parties also tend to confuse their positions with their
interests. Often parties are not used to thinking in terms of underlying interests.
Mediators should help to cultivate a positive attitude toward interest discovery in the
parties. </p>

<p>There are two types of procedures for discovering interests: indirect and direct.
Indirect procedures include testing, and hypothetical modeling. Mediators test for
interests by listening to a party's statements, tentatively identifying the interest
expressed, and then expressing that interest back to the party for further feedback. In
hypothetical modeling the party ranks a number of hypothetical settlements in terms of
satisfaction. Direct methods include questioning the parties, and brainstorming. Parties
may try to bluff, or misrepresent their interests. Mediators must be alert for such
bluffs, and try to call them. Mediators may use persuasion or rationalization to induce a
party to abandon their bluff and present a more accurate picture of their interests. The
mediator must also encourage each side in the dispute to acknowledge the other side's
interests, even if they do not agree with those interests. Finally the mediator should
incorporate both parties interests into a joint problem statement. A joint problem
statement &quot;enables negotiators to commit to work on a common problem because they
believe that their needs will be respected, if not met by, the solutions that will be
developed.&quot;[p. 243]</p>

<p>The parties are now ready to begin generating settlement options. Often the parties
must be convinced of the need to generate a range of different settlement options. For
instance, a party may believe that they already have the best solution, and merely need to
persuade the other side to accept it. Settlement options may address either specific
issues or general principles. There are two basic procedures for generating options:
positional bargaining and interest-based bargaining. Interest-based bargaining is more
likely to produce integrated, or win- win, outcomes, and so it is the preferred approach.
Here again however, cultural differences are significant. Chinese negotiators, for
example, often prefer positional bargaining.</p>

<p>Moore lists a number of specific procedures for generating settlement options. Where
the parties have an established relationship, they may proceed by ratifying the status
quo, that is, by specifying which elements of their current relationship they would like
to continue in the future. Parties may set boundaries for acceptable options by developing
objective standards. The parties may generate options by open discussion, either in small
groups or all together, or may use the more structured brainstorming procedure. Small
groups may be asked to develop hypothetical settlement scenarios. The parties may consider
settlement agreements from other similar disputes. They may identify linked issues, and
explore possible trade-offs. Or they may consider various comprehensive package
settlements. They may proceed by drafting and redrafting a single settlement proposal.
Rather than consider substantive settlements, the parties may seek an agreement on a
procedure for making decisions. Bringing in outside experts or other resources may help to
broaden the parties' perspectives on the dispute and on the range of possible solutions.
Research has found that stronger agreements tend to be substantive, comprehensive,
permanent, detailed, non-conditional and binding. Agreements which are procedural,
partial, provisional, abstract, contingent or non-binding tend to be weaker.</p>

<p>Reaching a Settlement</p>

<p>Having generated a range of settlement options, the parties must next evaluate those
options. Moore describes two evaluative tools: the settlement range and the best
alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA). A party's settlement range is defined by
the range from target point to resistance point. The target point is their optimal
outcome. The resistance point is set by those outcomes which are too costly or not
beneficial enough to accept, that is, below the party's BATNA. When the parties'
settlement ranges overlap there is a range of possible mutually acceptable settlements
available to the parties. Interest-based bargainers will seek the solution which provides
maximum mutual benefits. When the parties' settlement ranges have no overlap, there are no
mutually acceptable settlement options. In such cases the parties may be encouraged to
shift their target or resistance points, or the issues available for trade-off may be
expanded. Mediators can help the parties to identify and understand their settlement
ranges, and can deflate the parties' inflated expectations. Assisting the parties' in
identifying their BATNAs can also help to close any gap between the parties settlement
ranges.</p>

<p>After evaluating the options the parties enter the final bargaining stage, where they
negotiate to reach an agreement. Occasionally an agreement will have emerged directly out
of the evaluation stage. Usually however there is still a range of potential agreements,
some areas of disagreement, and a number of details to be worked out after the evaluation
stage. Moore identifies four basic strategies mediators use during the final bargaining
stage. In the incremental convergence strategy the parties each make small concessions
until they reach a mutually acceptable compromise. When positional bargainers use this
strategy the mediator's main task is to make the parties comfortable with making
concessions. In the leap-to-agreement the parties engage in some preliminary bargaining,
but then leap directly to accepting a comprehensive proposal. In the
agreement-in-principle strategy the parties first seek agreement on general principles,
and then seek to apply those principles to the situation at hand. This strategy is
particularly helpful in preventing negotiation deadlocks. When the parties cannot reach a
substantive agreement, they may use a procedural strategy. &quot;Procedural solutions are
process decisions that parties make to resolve disputes without directly deciding the
issue. Generally, the process determines a substantive answer.&quot;[p. 288] </p>

<p>Deadlines can play an important role in bringing the final bargaining to a close.
Deadlines may be internally or externally imposed, actual or artificial, rigid or
flexible, with or without consequences, explicit or vague. Mediators can help make the
parties aware of existing deadlines, or help parties establish deadlines as needed.
Mediators can also help the parties avoid harmful uses of deadlines, such as using
deadlines as threats or allowing deadlines to generate false agreement motivation.
Cultural attitudes toward time affect the use of deadlines. Some cultures view time as a
valuable and limited resource, while others have a much more leisurely attitude toward
time. </p>

<p>After final bargaining the rough agreement must be formalized and an implementation and
monitoring plan developed. To be effective the agreement must be put into action, and so a
well-designed implementation plan is crucial. Immediate, self-executing agreements are
easier to implement. However, many settlements will require parties to act over an
extended period of time. Implementation plans will be more successful when they include
criteria for measuring performance, methods for measuring and enforcing compliance,
general and specific implementation steps, and procedures for managing future changes or
conflicts. Some cultures incorporate implementation plans into the settlement itself,
while others approach implementation as a separate set of issues. </p>

<p>Agreement formalization provides an important symbolic end to the conflict and
increases the parties' commitment to the agreement. Formalization may take the form of
verbal promises or written agreements, and may be public or private. When the parties'
voluntary compliance is not sufficient, structural factors and external authority may be
used to enforce compliance. For example, the settlement may be made legally binding and
subject to judicial oversight, or the parties may be required to post performance bonds.</p>

<p>Moore concludes this section by discussing five common types of contingent mediator
tactics used for dealing with special situations. These include caucusing, mediator
pressure, power-relation management, negotiation teams, and constituency management.
Caucusing allows the mediator to communicate with one party privately and separately from
the other parties. The mediators may use caucuses for a number of purposes, including to
discuss confidential information, to interrupt negative emotional dynamics between the
parties, to identify the party's settlement range, or to discuss the party's negotiation
strategy. Mediators are able to influence negotiations by means of their control over the
process, setting and timing of negotiations, by their involvement in the parties'
communication and relationships, and by their access to both the parties information and
their ability to bring in outside experts. Generally mediators exercise their power in
order to move the parties toward a solution, while remaining neutral regarding the content
of the solution. </p>

<p>Mediation is most effective when the parties have symmetrical power relations. When the
parties have unequal power the mediator may need to balance their powers. In balancing the
parties' power &quot;the mediator provides the necessary power underpinnings to the weaker
negotiator: information, advise, friendship, she may reduce those of the
stronger.&quot;[p. 337] Complex, multiparty disputes may involve the use of negotiation
teams, rather individual negotiators. When negotiation teams are present, mediators will
need to pay attention to the interpersonal dynamics within as well as between the parties.
Mediators may seek to influence the choice of negotiation team members and the teams'
decision-making strategies. In some cases, the negotiated agreement must finally be
ratified by the negotiators' constituencies. In such cases the mediator will need to
assist the negotiators in communicating with their constituents and in organizing
constituent support for any agreement. The mediator may intervene directly with the
constituency groups to educate them regarding the negotiation process, and to reassure
them that their negotiation representatives have worked hard to achieve the best solution
possible.</p>

<p>Conclusions</p>

<p>Mediation is a broad and rapidly growing field. There are now many professional
mediation associations, focusing on areas ranging from divorce mediation to public policy
mediation. These associations generally seek to develop and improve the practice of
mediation by developing ethical standards, by offering mediation training, and by
promoting the use of mediation. Moore reviews a number of such mediation associations and
their activities. Generally, mediation codes of ethics require the mediator to be neutral
and impartial, to avoid conflicts of interest, to obtain informed consent for their
involvement from the parties, to maintain confidentiality, to reject cases which are
beyond their expertise, and to be truthful in advertising their services and fees. The
various associations' codes vary in their specifics. Research into mediation theory and
practice has led to a proliferation of high-quality mediation training programs. Moore
describes some of the basic elements of mediator training programs, including applicant
screening procedures, training formats and methodologies, instructor qualifications, and
criteria to guide the would-be mediator in selecting a program.</p>

<p>As the mediation field has developed, there has been an increasing trend in the public
and judicial spheres toward using mediated negotiation as an alternative to more
traditional means of dispute resolution. Legislation has been passed at the federal and
state levels encouraging the use of mediation and executive orders have also mandated the
development of alternative dispute resolution procedures in U. S. government agencies
where appropriate.</p>

<p>Finally, Moore sketches five developments which must occur if mediation is to become
even more widely utilized, and seven areas where the practice of mediation itself may be
further developed. In order for mediation to be more widely used the public must be better
educated about it, more research into mediation needs to be done, mediation must be more
fully institutionalized, mediation services must be more fully funded, and new
applications for mediation must be discovered. Moore suggests seven such new areas of
application: ethnic conflicts, intractable conflicts, violent conflicts, education for the
development of nonviolent cultures, dispute systems design, public governance, and global
environmental issues.</p>
