<p>The Conflict Research Consortium is a multidisciplinary program of research, teaching,
and application, focused on finding more constructive ways of addressing difficult,
long-term, and intractable conflicts, and getting that information to the people involved
in these conflicts so that they can approach them in a more constructive way. A joint
university-community program, the Consortium unites researchers, educators, and
practitioners from many fields for the purposes of theory-building, testing,
disseminating, and applying new conflict management techniques. These efforts are designed
to lead to an improved understanding of conflict dynamics, along with better methods for
confronting and managing intractable conflicts and reaching good decisions. Unlike our
colleagues who focus on comprehensive resolution, we take an incremental approach--
analyzing problems that make these conflicts unnecessarily destructive, and then
identifying effective incremental treatments. </p>

<p>Much of our effort over the past few years has been spent developing, testing, and
revising our theory of intractable conflicts, based on extensive collection of qualitative
data--stories from scholars, practitioners, and disputants--who have told us (either
directly or through their writing) about their conflicts and their conflict management
efforts. We have analyzed and organized these stories to create a theoretical list of
typical conflict problems and treatments. This information (with accompanying
explanations) will soon be available over the web, allowing users to identify specific
problems that are occurring in their own conflicts, read about related theory, and search
for possible remedies. The system is designed to act as a computerized consulting service
which will provide customized executive summaries (and back-up information) addressing
specific user interests.</p>

<p>In addition to helping neutral intervenors develop their professional skills, the
Consortium is also working to help adversaries develop a more sophisticated understanding
of conflict processes, and helping disputants develop what we call
&quot;do-it-yourself&quot; skills for the many situations in which professional assistance
is not available. We have developed and maintain an extensive web site of general conflict
information (over 1000 pages long-before the first phase of the international online
training program is added), and have been active in a variety of other teaching, training,
and intervention efforts, all focused on the intractable conflict theme. </p>

<p>The Consortium's inquiry into intractable conflict continues to be a long term-effort
which has evolved greatly over the last several years. Key to the success of our efforts
have been a continuing series of projects and activities in three broad areas. 

<ul>
  <li><strong>Knowledge Base Projects</strong> through which we continuously collect
    information on intractable conflict problems and more constructive strategies for dealing
    with these problems.</li>
  <li><strong>Theory Building / Knowledge Organization Projects</strong> which involve the
    development of new ways of thinking about intractable conflicts and organizing the
    information on specific problems and treatments. (Here theoretical work has provided a
    basis for organizing information from our knowledge base projects in ways which facilitate
    effective knowledge utilization and dissemination. Although earlier organization schemes
    have been linear and thus suited for traditional article and book formats, over the last
    several years we have also been developing hypertext systems which can be customized to
    the needs of individual users.)</li>
  <li><strong>Dissemination, Training, and Education Projects </strong>which distribute to
    adversaries, intermediaries, students, and the general public the results of the
    Consortium's work. Included here are presentations, courses, book and article publication,
    web-based dissemination efforts and consulting.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Knowledge Base Projects</strong></h2>
<font FACE="Times New Roman">

<hr>
</font>

<p>The Consortium's knowledge base concept is a bit unusual. The traditional research
model suggests that researchers need only understand a field's knowledge base sufficiently
to identify an area of the frontier in which they would like to work. At this point
researchers tend to become specialists, developing projects which push back that frontier
by making incremental additions to a field's overall base of knowledge. This approach has
produced a world dominated by specialists. While specialization is responsible for the
rapid advances in many fields, it is not a particularly good model for solving complex,
real-world problems. For that, we believe generalists are needed--researchers and programs
devoted to bringing a field's entire, multi-disciplinary body of knowledge to bear on
specific situations. The Consortium is trying to be such an organization. </p>

<p>To do this, we have pursued a series of projects designed to collect and organize as
much of the cumulative expertise of the conflict-resolution field as possible. We have
also sought to include applicable knowledge from related disciplines (e.g. law, political
science, military science). The Consortium's recent knowledge-base projects have included
the following: 

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hewlett Theory Building Center Conference on Intractable Conflict&nbsp; </strong>The
    CRC was requested by Steve Toben (Program Director of the Hewlett Conflict Resolution
    Program) to organize the January 1998 Hewlett Theory Centers Conference which was to focus
    on intractable conflict. This stimulating conference generated a number of useful ideas
    which we will be incorporating into our theory development work (with appropriate credit,
    of course).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><dl>
      <dt><strong><strong>Encyclopedia Research Project</strong> </strong>Research conducted for
        the <em>Encyclopedia of Conflict Resolution</em> provided the Consortium with an
        opportunity to conduct a comprehensive review of the entire field. This is in addition to
        the encyclopedia's primary role as a dissemination mechanism (see below).</dt>
    </dl>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <strong>
  <li><dl>
      <dt>USIP Case Example Collection </strong>A major component of the USIP online training
        project has been the systematic collection of international examples of conflict problems
        and treatments which are being incorporated into the knowledge base.</dt>
    </dl>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <strong>
  <li><dl>
      <dt>Transformative Project Research&nbsp; </strong>This project conducted a systematic
        search of the field for information about available strategies for transforming underlying
        conflictual relationships. This project was done in conjunction with the Training Design
        Consultation Project, directed by Baruch Bush and Joe Folger, and funded by Hewlett and
        Surdna.<strong></dt>
    </dl>
  </li>
  </strong>
</ul>

<ul>
  <strong>
  <li><dl>
      <dt>Internet Resource Identification&nbsp; </strong>Our continuing effort to identify
        web-accessible resources involves both automated search programs and the manual review of
        promising new sites by Consortium staff. </dt>
    </dl>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <strong>
  <li><dl>
      <dt>Case Study Archive and Issue Pages </strong>Our on-line archive of case studies of
        intractable conflicts also include a number of &quot;issue pages&quot; which use the web's
        search engines and key web sites to provide continually updated information on conflicts
        of widespread interest.</dt>
      <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Full Text Document Searching&nbsp; </strong>The Consortium's full working
    paper&nbsp;collection is now searchable online in full-text form. Our intention is to
    extend this system to include<font FACE="Times New Roman"> other research centers as well.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <strong>
  <li><dl>
      <dt>Cumulative Bibliographic Project </strong>All information received by the Consortium is
        automatically added to our &quot;resources&quot; database where it is available for
        searching at the Consortium's offices and over the web.</dt>
    </dl>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <strong>
  <li>Conferences and Seminars </strong>A major source of insights incorporated into the
    Consortium's knowledge base has come from our continuing series of seminars and
    conferences, all focused on intractable conflicts<strong>.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Theory Development/Knowledge Organization Project</strong>s</p>
</strong>

<hr>

<p>We have been developing and continuously revising our theory of intractable or
&quot;resolution-resistant&quot; conflicts for many years. While the basic approach is now
a couple of years old, we continue to add pieces and revise the way in which we think the
pieces best fit together. The goal of this theory-building effort is three-fold. One goal
is to develop, for ourselves and other scholars, a better understanding about the nature
of intractable conflicts-especially, what makes some conflicts intractable, while others
are not. The second goal is to develop a better understanding for theoreticians,
practitioners, and parties, of how intractable conflicts can be handled more
constructively. The third goal is to use our theoretical framework to organize the
multidisciplinary knowledge base that we have accumulated in a way that can be more easily
navigated and understood. We have so much information on so many diverse topics, that
having some sort of organization scheme is essential. By utilizing a scheme that makes
sense theoretically, the information builds upon itself, creating a knowledge base that is
more than a simple sum of the parts. Specific projects include the following. <strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Intractable Conflict / Constructive Confrontation Project</strong> </strong>The
    philosophy behind the Consortium program and its theory-building and knowledge
    organization efforts is described above.<strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>USIP Theory/Organizational Framework</strong> </strong>We have produced a
    revised version of our theoretical and organizational framework for the USIP project. This
    framework has a more international focus and is presented in a simpler way which is more
    accessible to people with limited English skills. <strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Virtual Diplomacy Paper&nbsp; </strong>We prepared a paper for the United States
    Institute of Peace's Virtual Diplomacy Conference outlining ways in which we believe that
    telecommunications technologies could advance the peacemaking process.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Transformative Approaches to Conflict</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Our <em>Mediation
    Quarterly</em> article compares Bush and Folger's transformative mediation and
    constructive confrontation. We have also done considerable research on transformative
    approaches to both tractable and intractable conflicts as part of our collaboration with
    Bush and Folger's Training Design Consultation Project.<strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Graduate Seminar</strong> </strong>The Consortium's graduate seminar which is
    taught jointly by Paul Wehr and Guy and Heidi Burgess continues to provide a lively
    setting in which new ideas are presented and debated. <strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Classic Social Science Theory Project </strong></strong>Working with Otomar
    Bartos, Paul Wehr is now in the process of writing a book highlighting the ways in which
    classical sociological theory contributes to a practical understanding of conflict. <strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dealing with Conflicts that Defy Resolution</strong>&nbsp; </strong>In keeping
    with the 1997 NCPCR Conference theme, we held a session in which participants shared their
    personal stories of how they have dealt with conflicts that have defied their best
    attempts at resolution.<strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Persistent Activist</strong>&nbsp; </strong>Paul Wehr and Jim Downton have
    recently published a study of long-term peace activists and the processes which sustain
    their intense personal commitment.<strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Multi-Perspective Access to the Knowledge Base.&nbsp; </strong>The Consortium is also
    working to make the incremental components of the field's knowledge base accessible from a
    variety of popular theoretical perspectives (in addition to the Consortium's constructive
    confrontation framework). For example, we expect the USIP project to present information
    from the perspectives of human needs theory, dispute systems design, conflict
    transformation, etc.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<ul>
  <li></strong>Knowledge-Base Papers&nbsp; The four academic papers which the Consortium wrote
    on the theory of information management in the peace and conflict field continue to
    provide guidance for our work. <strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Justice Without Violence Project</strong>&nbsp; </strong>We continue to draw
    upon a number of key ideas which emerged from our early<em> Justice Without Violence</em>
    project-a project which explored nonviolent ways to pursue justice around the world.<strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Dissemination, Training and Education Projects</strong></p>
</strong>

<hr>

<p>Dissemination of theoretical and practical knowledge about more constructive approaches
to conflict is one of our primary goals. While a great deal of our recent efforts have
involved dissemination over the world-wide web, we also rely on a variety of more
traditional methods: books, articles, presentations, classes, in-person training programs,
and consultations with scholars, conflict practitioners, and conflict parties both from
the U.S. and from other countries. We also teach a graduate seminar at the university
which explores our latest thinking on intractable conflicts, and occasionally assume
intervention roles in area conflicts. All of this keeps us firmly grounded in the
real-world problems and treatments and helps us resist the &quot;ivory-tower
syndrome.&quot; Aspects of our dissemination program include the following.<strong>

<ul>
  <li><em><strong>The Encyclopedia of Conflict Resolutio</strong>n&nbsp; </em></strong>Published
    in 1997 by ABC-CLIO, this widely accessible, general reference document provides
    libraries, conflict professionals, and others with an easy-to-use reference covering basic
    concepts, techniques, organizations, people, and events. The knowledge we gained in the
    process of writing this book has contributed substantially to our ability to complete many
    of our other knowledge-base projects. <strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Constructive Confrontation Book(s)</strong>&nbsp; </strong>During the last year,
    we have partially merged the intractable conflict book project and the USIP international
    distance learning project, putting most of our effort into the USIP, web-based
    dissemination of our general approach and supporting details. Nevertheless, we recognize
    the importance of supplementing the website with conventional print publications. As soon
    as the first phase of the USIP project is complete, we will be working to publish our
    theory of intractable conflict and constructive confrontation in book form as quickly as
    possible. We now envision two volumes. The first would be a simple, printed version of a
    selected subset of the USIP materials. (All the materials would be far too long.) A higher
    priority, however, will be a more general <em>Getting to Yes</em> type book that will
    explain our approach and why we believe that it offers a much<strong> </strong>more
    constructive ways of addressing intractable conflicts.<strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>USIP Online Training Program</strong>&nbsp; T</strong>he United States Institute
    of Peace online (and correspondence) training program will provide easy-to-use,
    inexpensive international access to the conflict knowledge base. It will also provide a
    model for future Consortium projects.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Web Site&nbsp; </strong>Even before adding the USIP component,&nbsp; the
    Consortium's primary dissemination mechanism was its web site which is one of (if not the)
    most extensive and content rich web sites in the field. Information is available through a
    variety of user interfaces including simple browsing of lists with descriptive
    information, full-text searching, and (forthcoming with the USIP project,) a guided search
    systems which emulates an interview with a skilled conflict consultant. We are also
    planning to add another interface to the web site which stresses the information that we
    have for different user groups.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Web Courses </strong></strong>Our first online course (on general conflict
    management) and the course associated with the USIP project (focusing on the constructive
    confrontation of intractable conflicts) are now available through the Division of
    Continuing Education.&nbsp; We also incorporating our web-based activities into the
    regular University teaching curriculum with the construction of course web sites.<strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Core Literature Abstracts&nbsp; </strong></strong>Our computer-searchable and
    web accessible database now contains lengthy abstracts of more than 300 important books in
    the conflict resolution, peace research, and environmental dispute resolution fields.</li>
