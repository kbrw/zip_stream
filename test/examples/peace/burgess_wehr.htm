<p>The International Online Training Program on Intractable Conflict provides a variety of
distance learning options for people interested in more constructive approaches to
difficult and intractable conflicts. Created by the University of Colorado Conflict
Research Consortium with support from the United States Institute of Peace and the Hewlett
Foundation, this program is available to Internet users world-wide at: </p>

<p align="center"><a href="http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/peace">http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/peace</a>
&nbsp; </p>

<p>The training program provides an economical alternative or supplement to travel-based
training for disputants and intermediaries. The program provides information on basic
conflict management strategies as well as more advanced techniques for dealing with
intractable conflicts. Materials can be used independently for self study or as a
supplementary resource which contributes to more conventional face-to-face training and
education programs. The program is written in simple language (with an online glossary) so
that it is appropriate for people with a limited knowledge of English. While it emphasizes
intractable conflict problems in the developing democracies and elsewhere in the
&quot;two-thirds&quot; world, this program is useful for anyone facing difficult conflict.
</p>

<p>Designed for people with limited access to the academic or professional literature, the
system contains over 1000 pages of full-text material with analyses of 100 common conflict
problems and 200 strategies for limiting those problems. Summaries of 200 articles and
books and links to another 200 web-accessible documents provide a theoretical background
for and illustrations of the ideas presented. The program also permits dialogue among
users, and encourages other conflict research, education, and training organizations to
join the project as collaborators.</p>

<h3><strong>Program Assumptions</strong></h3>

<p>Our approach to resolution-resistant conflicts draws heavily from conflict resolution
practice and peace and conflict scholarship. It also incorporates ideas from specialists
in advocacy, community organization, and nonviolent direct action. Unlike those who seek
resolution for its own sake, we seek justice, fairness, good decisions, and wise
solutions. Sometimes this means working to resolve a conflict, while at other times, it
means continuing the conflict, but in a more constructive way. </p>

<p>Another important element of our approach is that we use a smaller unit of analysis
than is common. Rather than looking at the conflict as a whole, we look at each aspect of
the conflict to see what is working well and what is not-and thus, what needs to be
changed. The approach suggested is different for each conflict situation-we do not try to
apply one standard approach to all situations. Our goal is to help users fix as many of
the incremental problems as possible, and reduce the magnitude of the remainder, thus
allowing users to pursue their goals in more positive ways, even before the conflict is
resolved.</p>

<p>Although many of our &quot;treatments&quot; require cooperation between contending
parties, (often through intermediaries), others can be implemented unilaterally.
Similarly, some treatments are relatively easy for the parties to implement, while others
require that they develop new dispute-handling skills or secure the assistance of conflict
professionals. </p>

<p>Unlike other forms of dispute resolution, this incremental approach can work in
situations where resolution-based approaches cannot. It is also appropriate where major
changes in dispute-handling processes or decision-making institutions are unlikely. In
addition to providing support for people in third-party, intermediary roles, the program
also highlights steps which disputants can take without third party intervention or
assistance. </p>

<h3><strong>The Knowledge Base</strong></h3>

<p>While there are no proven strategies for resolving intractable conflicts, the field's
growing knowledge base offers a rich array of ideas for handling inevitable confrontations
more constructively. While some ideas were developed specifically for this program, many
more were drawn from the knowledge, experience, and writing of others.</p>

<p>The problems, solutions, and examples given by no means exhaust the approaches for
dealing with intractable conflicts. Rather, we see the program as a starting point, which
is intended to stimulate users to think of new approaches to their own problems. A
principal advantage of this problem/treatment approach is its adaptability to the special
circumstances of particular users. No single approach can be expected to work in all
conflict situations. Each presents a different combination of problems, requiring a
different set of treatments.</p>

<h3><strong>How the Material Is Organized </strong></h3>

<p>The training program has five major sections: (1) a set of common conflict <em>problems</em>;
(2) a set of possible <em>treatments</em> for those problems, (3) a set of <em>examples</em>
of problems and treatments, (4) a group of background <em>theoretical essays</em> and (5)
a number of <em>resources and support services</em>.</p>

<p>The core of the system is made up of the two problem lists (one for core conflict
problems and one for &quot;complicating factors&quot;) and two matched treatment lists. By
clicking on a problem or a treatment, users are taken to an essay describing that topic in
more detail. They can then follow links to examples of the problem or treatment, or they
can read about related problems and/or treatments. They can also link to theoretical
essays, and to articles on other web sites. The resources and support services section
contains a glossary of specialized terms, a list of references (books and articles),
online discussion groups, information on how to reach and download material at low cost,
and hints for efficiently using the training program with different kinds of Internet
connections. </p>

<h3><strong>Using the Program</strong></h3>

<p>There are several ways to use this training program. Users who want quick answers to
specific questions can scan the problem and treatment lists for items that address their
specific needs. They can then follow links to lessons and related topics of interest. All
of the information on the web site is available free of charge, so they can use as much or
as little as they wish.</p>

<p>Students who want to gain an in-depth understanding of intractable conflicts and
constructive confrontation have two online course options. The work for both options is
the same: students are asked to read the theoretical background material, the problem and
treatment essays, and many of the examples. They then write a series of papers applying
ideas in the materials to their own situations or experiences. They are also encouraged to
critically compare their ways of dealing with conflict situations with those presented in
the training program. Thus, the program becomes elicitive as well as prescriptive. In
addition to providing instructor feedback and interaction, we also encourage online
dialogue between students in different parts of the world, thereby enhancing the
cross-cultural value of the course. For about $300, students who complete the course
satisfactorily can receive formal university credit for a 3 semester hour course. Those
who do not need credit can obtain a Consortium Certificate of Completion for $100. (We
have also established a scholarship program for users who cannot afford these charges.)</p>

<h3><strong>Audience</strong></h3>

<p>The primary program users will be people with access to the Internet who are interested
in alternative approaches to difficult conflict: government people, university faculty and
other teachers, representatives of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the mass media,
business executives, and others. While many potential users do not yet have access to
computers and the web, such access is expanding rapidly throughout the world.</p>

<p>There is a much larger secondary audience--people in contact with organizations which
have Internet access. For example, conflict research, training, and education
organizations can make the program available to their students, dispute resolution
practitioners to their clients, and advocacy groups to their constituents. Government
agencies can use the program for employee training. </p>

<p>At this early stage of audience development, we really do not know how large our user
group will be, but we expect it to grow quickly as more people become aware of the
program's availability. Unlike conventional, face-to-face training which is limited by
trainer resources and trainee time and money, copies of this program can be distributed
instantly and at virtually no cost. Users need not hire trainers, buy new materials, or
pay for travel expenses. The cost of online instruction is much less than comparable
face-to-face training, since the economies of Internet teaching permit a single instructor
to serve more students. Instructors can also be recruited from all over the world and the
online character of the program allows them to fit the work into their normal schedule. </p>

<h3><strong>Program Limitations</strong></h3>

<p>Despite the advantages of this system, it has limitations. First is the lack of
face-to-face communication. At this point, all interaction is by written word-through the
essays users read, papers they write, and online dialogues between instructors and
students, and among students. This limits the speed of interaction, the depth and richness
of face-to-face exchange, and the use of interactive exercises, role-plays, and
simulations. We hope to devise ways to overcome this limit in the near future.</p>

<p>A second constraint is limited access. Not all potential users have Internet access.
Yet many do, and the number of people with such access is growing constantly.</p>

<p>A third limit is the cultural bias the program now has. This system was written in the
U.S. and thus presents a U.S. orientation toward problem solving. People from other
cultures may be unfamiliar with this approach or find it difficult to apply in their
societies. We hope that such users, rather than dismissing the system, will contribute,
through feedback, alternative ways of defining problems and seeking solutions. As users
from other societies and cultures do this, the system can become much more cross-cultural.</p>

<h3><strong>Anticipated Impact</strong></h3>

<p>The Online Training Program on Intractable Conflict is a comprehensive and versatile
learning resource which provides users with easy access to a great deal of useful
information which was previously much more difficult to obtain. It is our hope that
disputants and third parties will turn to this resource when they feel &quot;stuck&quot;
in a conflict situation they don't know how to handle, or one that seems to be going from
good to bad. If each of the thousands of users we anticipate takes away one or two new
ideas about addressing their conflict problems in more constructive ways, the program is
likely to have a significant impact. Beyond such incremental impact, we hope the program
will lead users to see intractable conflicts in a new way, allowing them to reframe their
problems and develop approaches to them that are more constructive.</p>

<h3><strong>Further Development</strong></h3>

<p>The completion of our work under the USIP grant does not signal the end of this
project. Rather, it represents a step in our long-term effort to improve web-based
conflict training and education. We are excited about the program's ability to incorporate
ideas from users and from conflict organizations which join the project as partners. By
collaborating with colleagues and users around the world, we hope to increase the quality
of the system significantly. We are also beginning to add exercises and roleplays, which
should add to the interest and elicitive nature of the program. We expect the program's
impact&nbsp;to grow substantially as we continue to refine the system and as the reach of
the Internet continues to expand. </p>
