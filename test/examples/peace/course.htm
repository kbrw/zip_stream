<h1 align="center">Online Course for Credit or Certification</h1>

<hr>

<p>Students wishing to receive university credit or a certificate for the online course
are expected to read all of the material presented on this website,<font color="#800000">*</font>
&nbsp; and then try to apply some of it to their own lives by writing a series of papers
about the material and about their own experiences relating to difficult, prolonged, or
intractable conflicts.&nbsp; Since the website is, indeed, a fairly complicated web, much
of the material is interlinked. We suggest you go through it one unit at a time, reading
the background (theoretical) material presented in Unit 1, and then moving on to Framing
and Scoping Problems and Treatments in Unit 2, and so on.&nbsp; Read the detailed write-up
on each problem and each solution, as well as the material that links to each of those
write-ups.&nbsp; Since each problem, solution, and example is linked to several other
problems, solutions, and examples, it will not take long for you to find that you are
linking to things you have already read.&nbsp; When this happens, you don't have to read
the material again (unless, of course, you want to review it in the context of what you
just read).&nbsp; </p>

<p>Once you have read through all the material in a particular unit (including the full
write-ups, the links to related problems, solutions, and examples), you will then need to
write a five page essay about the material presented in the unit.&nbsp; (See below for
more information).&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong><font color="#800000">*NOTE:</font></strong>&nbsp; Many of the problem and
solution write ups have links to outside sources of information.&nbsp; These are links to
websites produced by other people and organizations, not the Conflict Consortium.&nbsp;
While we think you may find these sites very interesting and useful, they are not required
reading for the course (they are far too extensive for that!)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Assignments&nbsp; </h2>

<h2>Course Unit Papers&nbsp;</h2>

<p>(One is required for each of the eight units.)</p>

<p><em><strong>For each unit</strong></em> write a five page essay summarizing, from your
perspective, the principal conflict problems discussed in that unit and the most effective
strategies for dealing with those problems. While this essay should initially be based
upon training program materials, you are asked to focus only on those problems and
treatment strategies which, from your perspective, are&nbsp; important and useful. (They
might be particularly applicable to a conflict you know about or are involved in, or seem
important to you for everyday life).&nbsp; You should also feel free to criticize the
ideas&nbsp; presented in the materials and offer your own alternative approaches. Users
for whom English is not their native language should not spend a lot of effort trying to
get the English just right. We are very understanding about the problems of writing in
multiple languages.&nbsp; Assignments should simply be e-mailed to<big> </big><a
href="mailto:crc@colorado.edu">crc@colorado.edu</a> and we will respond by return e-mail.</p>

<h3>Organization of Program Materials</h3>

<p>Each of the program sections lists common conflict problems with a short
description.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you click on a problem you will receive: 1) a more detailed
description of the problem; 2) links to actual examples of the problem; 3) a list of
possible solutions to the problem, and 4) links to closely related problems. You will get
a similar list of choices if you go to the solution list for a particular problem. In this
case you will see a list of possible solutions of each problem along with a two sentence
description.&nbsp; When you click on a solution you will receive: 1)&nbsp; a more detailed
description; 2) examples of&nbsp; how the solution has been implemented in an actual
conflict situation; and 3) see a list of other problems that this solution helps deal
with.&nbsp; To simplify programming, it is often necessary to go back to the previous
screen to get the menu of other choices.&nbsp;&nbsp; To do this use the &quot;go
back&quot; arrow on your browser. You can also use the menu bar if you selected it at the
opening screen.</p>

<p>The units presented in the course are divided into four parts.&nbsp; The first part
gives background information.&nbsp; This part focuses primarily on general concepts,
theoretical ideas, and overarching assumptions.&nbsp; It provides background knowledge
about the nature and functions of conflict, why and when it occurs, and how it can be
approached both practically and theoretically.&nbsp; </p>

<p>This introductory unit is followed by three groups of problem and treatment units.
&nbsp; The first problem/treatment group involves problem definition--defining what the
conflict is about (framing), who is involved, and what the context of the conflict is
(scoping). Without an accurate understanding of the people and/or issues involved and how
the conflict relates to other situations (past and present), it is very hard to confront
any conflict in an effective way. </p>

<p>The second problem/treatment part looks at complicating factors that often make
conflicts worse than they really should be and more difficult to handle constructively,
even if one takes care of all of the problems discussed earlier. These complicating
factors include communication problems, fact-finding problems, procedural problems, and
escalation.</p>

<p>The third problem/treatment section examines confrontation strategies. People involved
in conflicts can do one of two things. They can withdraw from the conflict, or they can
confront it in some way. When they confront it, they are trying to influence the situation
in a way which will benefit themselves. They may use force, they may try to negotiate, or
they may try to persuade the opponent to change his or her attitudes and/or behavior using
what we call &quot;integrative strategies.&quot; &nbsp; Sections address each of these
three topics as well as overall treatment strategies which combine multiple approaches.</p>

<p>There is one variation in this structure, however, involving unit 7.&nbsp; This unit
combines one complicating factor category (procedural problems and solutions) with one
confrontation strategy category (exchange problems and solutions).&nbsp; We combined these
because most of the procedural problems involve negotiation and related processes which
are the primary exchange strategies.&nbsp; For this reason, we thought it most logical to
combine these into one unit for the purpose of the course.</p>

<h2>Final Case Study Paper 36%</h2>

<p>The second assignment for the course asks you to write a detailed case study (at least
20 pages) describing an actual conflict situation and applying the ideas that you have
learned from reading the material presented in this program to that situation.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here you have three choices. 1) You can apply the ideas learned in the class
to an actual conflict in which you are involved and then report the results. (How well did
things work or not work? Why?) 2) The second possibility is for you to systematically
observe an ongoing conflict in your community, reporting how the conflict is being handled
and the results of that approach. You should also make recommendations suggesting more
constructive ways of handling the issue.&nbsp; 3) Alternatively, you can do an in-depth
case study based upon library research about a&nbsp; conflict that you are not personally
able to observe.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>As a further guide, you should consider addressing the following questions.&nbsp; In
considering these questions, please feel free to disregard those that are not applicable
or very important. Concentrate your efforts on those important aspects of the conflict
which really seem to be making a difference.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>What are the core issues? </li>
    <li>Who are the parties? </li>
    <li>What, if any, framing problems have arisen? How might they be limited? </li>
    <li>What, if any, fact-finding problems have arisen? How might they be limited? </li>
    <li>What, if any, procedural problems have arisen? How might they be limited? </li>
    <li>What, if any, misunderstandings have arisen? How might they be limited? </li>
    <li>Has escalation emerged as a problem? How might it be limited? </li>
    <li>What alternatives to a negotiated agreement do the parties think that they have? </li>
    <li>What efforts are the parties making to persuade their opponents to change their mind? </li>
    <li>What negotiation efforts are being pursued? Could be pursued? </li>
    <li>How do you think that the conflict could be handled more constructively? </li>
  </ul>

<p>At this time the online training program does not include any exercises or role plays.
We are, however, planning to add some in the near future.</p>
