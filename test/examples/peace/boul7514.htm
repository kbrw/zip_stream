<p>Kenneth E. Boulding, Three Faces of Power, (Newbury Park, California: Sage
Publications, 1989).</p>

<p>Boulding examines the nature of power. His analysis reveals three types of power:
destructive, economic, and integrative. Boulding examines each type of power both from a
personal and an organizational perspective. He closes this work by considering the role of
power in biological and social evolution.</p>

<p>The Nature of Power</p>

<p>In his first four chapters Boulding describes the nature of power as a social
structure. He describes the objects and pathologies of power. Boulding begins with the
simple definition of power as the ability to get what one wants. From there he breaks the
notion of power down into three general categories, based on the consequences of the
exercise of power. Destructive power is the power to destroy. Threats are a typical
exercise of destructive power, and the military is an example of an institution organized
around destructive power. Productive power is the power to make and create. Exchange and
trade are typical productive behaviors, and economics is an organized form of productive
power. Integrative power is the power to create relationships and bring people together.
Relationships of love and respect rest on integrative power, and social groups use
integrative power to gain members and maintain their loyalty. Boulding cautions that each
type of power has positive and negative uses. For instance, destructive power is used
positively when a doctor destroys a tumor. He also observes that while one type of power
may predominate in some behaviors or organizations, generally there are elements of each
type present.</p>

<p>Boulding addresses the distribution of power by examining the social structures of
power. He argues that power in groups tends to be hierarchical. Due to human limitations
on the ability to communicate, decision-making roles develop. Instructions flow down the
hierarchy, while information flows up. Within a hierarchical structure, power is limited
by available knowledge. Boulding also argues that &quot;hierarchical power cannot survive
unless it can be legitimated. Authority in some sense is always granted from
below.&quot;[p. 44] Examples of structures of power include the institution of property,
and the nation-state. Power structures generally rest on a complex mix of the three types
of power. Boulding says that the role of integrative power in maintaining structures is
both the most important, and the least recognized or understood.</p>

<p>Boulding considers three classes of objects of power: material objects, non-human
animals and other living creatures, and persons. The exercise of power over humans is
greatly complicated by persons' independent wills. Generally the choice of which type of
power to use will depend in part on the nature of the object. You cannot bribe a tree to
fall; only destructive power will do. Occasionally power will be exercised for its own
sake, without any object. Sometimes the object of an exercise of one type of power is to
increase other one's ability to exercise other types of power.</p>

<p>The old saying that &quot;power corrupts&quot; recognizes the potential for some
exercises of power to become pathological. Boulding notes however that it is not merely
power which may be corrupting, but also influence, and even powerlessness. Boulding argues
that the primary source of pathology is an unrealistic image of one's power, and suggests
possible causes of such unrealistic images. Each type of power has its own pathological
forms. An example of pathology is the use of national power simply to maintain a state's
position in the international &quot;pecking order.&quot; Civil wars have a high potential
to become pathological. Pathological concentrations of power can develop when power
attracts more power, or when &quot;the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.&quot;
Conflicts, which are always at root about distributions of power, can become pathological
when third-parties who do not bear the costs of the conflict benefit from it. </p>

<p>Personal Power</p>

<p>The next four chapters examine the destructive, economic and integrative types of
personal power. Personal power refers to the power wielded by an individual. Generally
destructive power is the easiest form of power for an individual to use. Because it is the
easiest to use, people often exercise destructive power to counter their feelings of
powerless. Defensive power can be used in self-defense, or it can be used to threaten
others. Defensive power plays a role in maintaining an integrated society. The threat of
social exclusion helps keep people obedient to social norms. Personal destructive power
plays a large role in certain political systems, such as dictatorships. Just as tyrants
rule by physical threat, some religious leaders may control their adherents by the use of
spiritual threats. The greatest exercise of personal destructive power is when one person
has the power to declare war. One of the dangers of destructive power is that when
individuals (or organizations) have specialized in destructive power, they often feels
compelled to use that power, lest it erode from disuse. People will create opportunities,
or &quot;pick a fight,&quot; in order to use their destructive abilities.</p>

<p>Personal economic power is most easily measured by the amount of money an individual
controls, although there are factors which complicate this measurement. One is the
difficulty in distinguishing clearly between the economic power of an individual and a
household. Another is the distinction between income, wealth, and consumption. One element
of economic power which cannot be easily measured by money is the value of a person's
physical and mental abilities. Personal economic power will depend in part upon the
inheritance practices in the larger society, and partly upon an individual's skill and
luck in increasing their original stake. There seems to be a limit to the ability of
economic power to improve an individual's quality of life, that is, there seems to be a
point at which further riches will not substantially improve an individual's life.</p>

<p>Boulding says that integrative power is both the most difficult to define and yet
potentially the most significant form of power. For example, both destructive and economic
power must be legitimate to be fully effective, and legitimacy is an aspect of integrative
power. Jesus, Muhammad and the Buddha are exemplars of integrative power; none of the
three had great destructive or economic power. The most basic form of integrative power is
love, in the widest sense. And love is most powerful when it is reciprocated. Boulding
sees respect as another example of integrative power at work. Respect is then closely
related to legitimacy. The creation and maintenance of individuals' identities depends on
the integrative system in a society. Individuals gain their particular identities by
gaining the respect and acknowledgment of others. Personal integrative power relies on the
complex social network of integrative power, which in turn depends on a network of
communication and learning. The degree of integrative power possible is higher in
societies in which learning is open-ended. Boulding discusses the paradoxical integrative
power of the weak. An individuals' weakness and neediness creates a demand on the stronger
to help and support the weak. Having a network of friends tends to both increase personal
integrative power, and to lead to further friendships, and so further gains in integrative
power. </p>

<p>Boulding concludes this section with a discussion of the dynamics of the three types of
personal power over the course of an individual's life. </p>

<p>Organizational Power</p>

<p>The next set of chapters examines destructive, economic and integrative power in
organizations. Destructive power plays two main roles in society. Destruction may be the
first stage in a productive process, such as clearing land for farming. Or destructive
power may by used to make and carry out threats. The military is a prime example of an
organization of destructive power for this second role. Boulding notes that while
destructive power is needed to make threats, threats are most effective when they are made
in an integrative context which legitimates the demand for submission. Integrative power
also plays a crucial role in maintaining the sense of community and commitment needed to
mobilize armies and motivate soldiers.</p>

<p>Boulding questions the view that destructive power can be used defensively, as
deterrence, to maintain peace. He argues that such strategies have resulted in an
escalating spiral of threats and counter-threats. As with personal destructive power, the
existence of organized destructive power encourages it use. Creating and maintaining
organizations of destruction has a high cultural and economic cost. Drawing on historical
cases, Boulding argues many nations have had periods of cultural and economic development
after being defeated in war, thus questioning the benefit of maintaining a strong military
for defense. While military organizations point out their beneficial economic
side-effects, such as employment or technical developments, Boulding points out that
economic benefits would almost certainly be greater had the resources devoted to the
military been directed directly toward economic development. Boulding also suggests that,
very often, &quot;an increase in military power diminishes the personal power of private
citizens.&quot;[p. 154]</p>

<p>Economic power is a factor in all organizations, because all organizations need
resources to exist. Governments, for example, consume labor and generate revenues by
taxation. However economic power is central to business and corporate organizations, which
use this power to generate profits. Boulding reviews, in general terms, several economic
theories of the origins of profit, and the relation between profits, interest, and
unemployment. He concludes that &quot;economic power in organizations is strangely
fragile, unpredictable, and to a surprising extent in the control of quite unconscious
processes in society, over which no single person or group has any real control or
power.&quot;[p. 163] There are a few general guidelines for increasing an organization's
economic power. Companies can sell more stock. They can save. They can grow and innovate.
Business monopolies increase economic power, but can be difficult to maintain. Boulding
also considers the economic power of the household organization, and of the family.</p>

<p>Since all organizations have some economic component, Boulding describes integrative
organizations as those whose primary purpose is not the pursuit of profit. &quot;A major
source of the integrative power of a community or organization is the degree to which the
personal identity of the members involved is bound up with their perception of the
identity of the community or organization as a whole.&quot;[p. 173] Integrative power
generally plays a large role in maintaining religious organizations, for example. When
coupled with the diversity of human organizations, strong identification with groups can
lead to conflicts. Sometimes threat power is used to enforce identification with the
group. These threats can range from police action, to divine retribution, and it is this
combination of integrative and threat power which accounts for the enduring influence of
nations and religions. In participatory political systems, however, promises tend to be
more effective than threats alone. Boulding also argues that integrative power, in the
form of an expanded sense of community, is the key to creating and expanding peace.</p>

<p>The dynamics of power over the life of an organization are complex and variable.
Boulding offers some general observations on the shifts in power in nation states,
business organizations, integrative organizations, political parties and social groups.</p>

<p>Power in Evolution</p>

<p>The final chapters discuss the role of power in biological evolution and in social
evolution. Boulding concludes this work with a discussion of how a better understanding of
power can help shape a better future. Boulding identifies three types of evolution:
physical and chemical, biological, and social. He notes that power in broadest sense is
simply the potential for change. In this sense, power is clearly involved in all three
types of evolution. The development of life was also a great increase in power, since
living organisms are able to change in response to their environment, and even to change
their environment. </p>

<p>Boulding argues that much of biological evolution is cooperative, in the sense that
species are mutually dependent. Even predator and prey species are mutually dependent for
their survival. And while biological evolution involves destruction, the use of threats in
biological evolution is virtually nonexistent. Boulding identifies cooperation as an
unconscious form of integrative power. In social cooperation the use of integrative power
becomes conscious.</p>

<p>Boulding goes on to consider the role of power in past human social evolution. He
argues that &quot;the increase in the productive and integrative powers of the human race
have been much more significant than the increase in its destructive powers, at least up
to the present century.&quot;[p. 226] Threats played very little role in humanity's early
development. Threats played a larger role after the development of agriculture. Organized
warfare came into existence relatively recently, with the rise of civilization. And
Boulding argues that, despite historians' fascination with war and strife, &quot;at least
90 percent of human activity even in the age of civilization was peaceful--plowing,
sowing, and reaping, cooking, weaving, and building, making pottery and tools, eating,
feasting, singing, worshiping, dancing, having and raising children, and so on.&quot;[p.
223]</p>

<p>Given this analysis of past human development, Boulding asks what present uses of power
would allow humanity to avoid nuclear annihilation or environmental disaster, and lead to
a better future. Although the problem is a complex one, Boulding identifies some of the
factors which must be considered in forming an answer. Key to finding a better future, he
concludes, is a better understanding of the types, uses and dynamics of power.</p>
